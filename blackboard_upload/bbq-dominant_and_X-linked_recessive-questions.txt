MC	<p>20. <p><strong>Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) </strong> is an X-linked recessive genetic disorder that is caused by a mutation in the AR gene for the human androgen receptor. This results in partial or complete inability of cells to respond to androgens. The disorder affects 1 in 20,000. Individuals affected with AIS have impaired development of male genitals and male secondary sexual characteristics at puberty. The defective gene for AIS is located on the long arm of chromosome X at position 11. </p><p><strong>Huntington's disease (HD) </strong> is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that is caused by an increase in trinucleotide repeats in the HTT gene. This results in a mutated Huntington protein that is toxic to certain cell types, particularly brain cells. The disorder affects 1 in 10,000 adults of European descent. Individuals affected with HD have physical abilities that gradually worsen and mental abilities that decline into dementia.
