true_statements:
  truth1a: Chymotrypsin prefers to cleave after large aromatic amino acids.
  truth2a: The shape of the S1 pocket of Chymotrypsin helps determine which residues
    are cut.
  truth2b: The amino acid tyrosine fits well into the S1 pocket of Chymotrypsin.
  truth2c: The amino acid phenylalanine fits well into the S1 pocket of Chymotrypsin.
  truth2d: The amino acid tryptophan fits well into the S1 pocket of Chymotrypsin.
  truth3a: The S1 pocket of Chymotrypsin is designed to bind hydrophobic side chains.
  truth3b: The S1 pocket of Chymotrypsin is deep and hydrophobic.
  truth3c: The substrate specificity of Chymotrypsin is mostly due to the properties
    of its S1 pocket.
  truth4a: Chymotrypsin helps break down dietary proteins into smaller peptides.
  truth4b: Chymotrypsin is used to digest proteins in the small intestine.
  truth5a: Chymotrypsin sometimes cleaves after hydrophobic amino acids, leucine and
    methionine.
  truth6a: Chymotrypsin works in two main phases, cutting and resetting.
  truth6b: The free Chymotrypsin enzyme is regenerated using water in the second phase
    of the reaction.
  truth21a: Chymotrypsin contains a cleft where peptide bonds are broken.

    glutamine.
  false5d: Chymotrypsin sometimes cleaves after the positively charged amino acid,
    lysine.
  false6a: Chymotrypsin cuts proteins all at once, without forming intermediates.
  false11a: Water has no role in the enzyme function of Chymotrypsin.
  false11b: Chymotrypsin does not require water at any point in its mechanism.
  false12a: Chymotrypsin requires ATP to cleave peptide bonds.
