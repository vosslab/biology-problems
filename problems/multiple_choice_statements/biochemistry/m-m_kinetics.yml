true_statements:
  truth1a: The reaction rate is proportional to the substrate concentration.
  truth2a: M-M kinetics assumes the enzyme has a single active site.
  truth2b: M-M kinetics does not apply to allosteric enzymes.
  truth3a: M-M kinetics was developed by German biochemist Leonor Michaelis and Canadian
    physician Maud Menten in 1913.
  truth4a: M-M kinetics assumes a quasi-steady state, that the enzyme-substrate complex
    [ES] is constant.
  truth4b: M-M kinetics assumes that the change in concentration of enzyme-substrate
    complex [ES] does not change.
  truth4c: M-M kinetics assumes that the concentration of enzyme-substrate complex
    [ES] is constant.
  truth4d: M-M kinetics assumes that the rate of breaking the enzyme-substrate complex
    [ES] is equal to the rate of its formation.
  truth5a: M-M kinetics assumes that the enzyme bound to the product [EP] is short
    lived and does not contribute to the reaction rate.
  truth5b: M-M kinetics assumes that the enzyme-product complex [EP] is short lived
    and does not contribute to the reaction rate.
  truth6a: M-M kinetics assumes that there is no product available and there is no
    measureable reverse reaction rate.
  truth6b: M-M kinetics assumes that the product is not available and there is no
    measureable reverse reaction rate.
  truth7a: When the substrate concentration, [S], is much larger than K<sub>M</sub>,
    the reaction rate is constant.
  truth7b: When the substrate concentration, [S], is much smaller than K<sub>M</sub>,
    the reaction rate is linear.
