true_statements:
  truth1a: Chemical reactions always involve a change in the chemical composition
    of substances.
  truth2a: Chemical reactions always transform one or more substances into one or
    more different substances.
  truth3a: The rate of a chemical reaction depends on temperature, pressure, and the
    presence of catalysts.
  truth4a: Chemical reactions always involve the forming and breaking of chemical
    bonds
  truth5a: For chemical reactions to occur, the chemical identity of the substances
    must change.
  truth5b: For chemical reactions to occur, the chemical formulas of both the reactant
    and the product can be the same.
  truth11a: Salt (NaCl) dissolving in water, breaking the ionic bonds between Na<sup>+</sup>
    and Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>, is a physical change.
  truth15a: Chemical reactions are involved in many important processes in biology.
  truth15b: Chemical reactions play a role in many important biological processes.
  truth16a: Chemical reactions are always either exothermic or endothermic.
false_statements:
  false5a: For chemical reactions to occur, the chemical formula of the substances
    must change.
  false5b: For chemical reactions to occur, the chemical formulas of both the reactant
    and the product cannot be the same.
  false5c: For chemical reactions to happen, the chemical identity of both reactants
    and products remains the same.
  false11a: Chemical reactions always involve physical changes.
  false11b: Chemical reactions only involve physical changes.
  false11c: Ice melting into water is a chemical reaction.
  false11d: Sugar (glucose) dissolving in water is a chemical reaction.
  false11e: Sublimation of dry ice into carbon dioxide gas is a chemical reaction.
  false11f: Salt (NaCl) dissolving in water is a chemical reaction since breaking
    ionic bonds forms new chemicals.
  false12a: Chemical reactions only occur when energy is added.
  false12b: Chemical reactions only occur when energy is released.
  false13a: Chemical reactions only occur at a specific temperature.
  false14a: Chemical reactions only occur in the presence of light.
  false15a: Chemical reactions only occur in living organisms.
  false15b: Reactions that occur in living organisms are not chemical reactions.
  false16a: Chemical reactions are always exothermic.
  false16b: Chemical reactions are always endothermic.
  false16c: Chemical reactions cannot be exothermic.
  false16d: Chemical reactions cannot be endothermic.
  false17a: Chemical reactions always result in a decrease in the total energy of
    the system.
  false17b: Chemical reactions always result in an increase in the total energy of
    the system.
  false18a: Chemical reactions always result in a decrease in the number of atoms.
  false18b: Chemical reactions always result in an increase in the number of atoms.
  false19a: Chemical reactions always result in a decrease in entropy.
  false19b: Chemical reactions always result in an increase in entropy.
