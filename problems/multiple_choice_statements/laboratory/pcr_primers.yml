true_statements:
  truth1: the primers are about 18 to 30 nucleotides in length
  truth2: the primers are complementary to highly conserved regions of the genome
  truth3: both primers have about the same melting temperature
  truth5a: the primers' sequences do not bind to each other to form primer-dimers
  truth5b: the primers do not have any complementary regions to each other
  truth6: the ends of the primer sequence must not bind to form secondary structures
  truth7: the percentage of G/C bases in the range of 40% to 60%
  truth8: the primers have a melting temperature in the range of 50&deg;C to 65&deg;C
  truth9: the primers would ideally have unique sequences that a deficient in 1 of the 4 nucleotides

false_statements:
  false1a: the primers are shorter than 10 nucleotides in length
  false1b: the primers are at least 50 nucleotides in length, if not longer
  false2: the primers are complementary to highly variable regions of the genome
  false3: each primer has a unique melting temperature, one is high and one is low
  false4: the primers are rich in A/T bases at the 3&prime; end to ensure good binding
  false5a: the primers are mostly complementary to each other
  false5b: the primers can readily bind to form primer-dimers
  false6: the ends of each primer are self-complementary to form strong secondary structure
  false7a: the percentage of G/C bases are less than 30%
  false7b: the percentage of G/C bases are more than 70%
  false8a: the primers have a melting temperature less than 42&deg;C
  false8b: the primers have a melting temperature more than 68&deg;C
  false9: both primers must always contain all four possible nucleotides
