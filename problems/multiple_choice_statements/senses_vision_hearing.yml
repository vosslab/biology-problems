true_statements:
  truth1a: Rhodopsin consists of an opsin protein plus a retinal chromophore.
  truth1b: Rhodopsin is formed when opsin binds retinal.

  truth2a: Light causes retinal isomerization that triggers a conformational change in opsin.
  truth2b: Photon absorption changes retinal shape and activates rhodopsin.

  truth3a: In rods, activated rhodopsin activates a G protein that leads to phosphodiesterase activation.
  truth3b: Phototransduction uses a G protein cascade that activates PDE.

  truth4a: In rods, PDE activity lowers cGMP concentration.
  truth4b: Phototransduction reduces cGMP by increasing its breakdown.

  truth5a: Lower cGMP closes CNG channels in rod outer segments.
  truth5b: Rod CNG channels close when cGMP levels fall.

  truth6a: Rod photoreceptors hyperpolarize in response to light.
  truth6b: Light reduces inward current in rods, causing hyperpolarization.

  truth7a: In darkness, rods have relatively high cGMP and open CNG channels.
  truth7b: Dark current in rods is supported by cGMP gated channel opening.

  truth8a: Cones support color vision and function best at higher light levels than rods.
  truth8b: Rods are more sensitive to low light than cones.

  truth9a: Hearing depends on mechanotransduction in hair cells of the inner ear.
  truth9b: Sound is converted into electrical signals by hair cell deflection.

  truth10a: Tip links connect stereocilia and contribute to opening mechanosensitive transduction channels.
  truth10b: Mechanical tension through tip links can gate hair cell transduction channels.

  truth11a: Hair cell depolarization can occur when K+ enters from K+ rich endolymph.
  truth11b: K+ influx from endolymph can drive hair cell depolarization.

  truth12a: Hair cells release neurotransmitter to afferent neurons when depolarized.
  truth12b: Hair cell signaling to the auditory nerve occurs through synaptic transmission.

  truth13a: Unlike many sensory receptors that depolarize to stimulus, rods hyperpolarize to light.
  truth13b: Rods are unusual because the light response is hyperpolarization, not depolarization.

false_statements:
  false1a: Rhodopsin is a receptor tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates retinal.
  false1b: Rhodopsin is an ion channel that directly conducts photons into the cell.

  false2a: In rods, light increases cGMP to open more CNG channels.
  false2b: Phototransduction begins by synthesizing cGMP from GDP.

  false3a: Activated rhodopsin directly converts ATP into cGMP without enzymes.
  false3b: Phototransduction activates adenylyl cyclase to raise cAMP in rods.

  false4a: PDE increases cGMP concentration by synthesizing it from GTP.
  false4b: PDE terminates signals by producing cGMP in the outer segment.

  false5a: Rod CNG channels open when cGMP levels fall.
  false5b: CNG channels close in darkness because cGMP is highest in light.

  false6a: Rod photoreceptors depolarize strongly in response to light.
  false6b: Light opens sodium channels in rods and increases inward current.

  false7a: In darkness, rods have low cGMP and all CNG channels are closed.
  false7b: Dark current is produced by closing CNG channels in rod outer segments.

  false8a: Cones are more sensitive to dim light than rods.
  false8b: Rods are responsible for most color discrimination in bright light.

  false9a: Hearing relies mainly on GPCR signaling cascades that take seconds to operate.
  false9b: Hair cells detect sound by photoreception in the cochlea.

  false10a: Tip links prevent ion channels from opening and block mechanotransduction.
  false10b: Tip links stabilize stereocilia but do not help gate mechanotransduction channels.

  false11a: Hair cells depolarize mainly because Na+ enters from endolymph through ENaC channels.
  false11b: Hair cells depolarize mainly because K+ leaves the cell into endolymph when stereocilia deflect.

  false12a: Hair cells do not use synapses and communicate only by gap junctions to the auditory nerve.
  false12b: Hair cells send action potentials down the cochlea without neurotransmitter release.
