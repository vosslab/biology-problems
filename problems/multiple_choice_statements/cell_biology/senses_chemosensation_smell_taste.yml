true_statements:
  truth1a: Many odorant receptors are GPCRs expressed in olfactory sensory neurons.
  truth1b: Olfactory receptors are commonly seven-transmembrane GPCR proteins.
  truth2a: In olfaction, an odorant can activate a G protein that stimulates adenylyl
    cyclase.
  truth2b: Odorant binding can lead to Golf activation and increased cAMP production.
  truth3a: cAMP can open cyclic nucleotide gated (CNG) ion channels in olfactory neurons.
  truth3b: In olfaction, cAMP can act as a second messenger that gates ion channels.
  truth4a: Olfactory sensory neurons typically express one olfactory receptor gene.
  truth4b: A single olfactory sensory neuron usually expresses one receptor type.
  truth5a: Odor identity is encoded by patterns of activity across many receptor types.
  truth5b: Many odorants activate multiple receptors, producing a combinatorial code.
  truth6a: Salty taste commonly involves ion movement through channels rather than
    GPCR signaling.
  truth6b: Salty taste is often detected by direct ion flow across the membrane.
  truth7a: Sour taste is linked to high acidity and elevated H3O+ in foods.
  truth7b: Sour tastants are associated with low pH and increased proton concentration.
  truth7c: In sour sensing cells, protons (H+) can directly change ion channel activity.
  truth8a: Sweet taste commonly uses a GPCR pathway rather than a simple ion channel
    pore.
  truth8b: Sweet taste is often detected by GPCR type receptors on taste cells.
  truth9a: Bitter taste commonly uses GPCR type receptors and downstream signaling.
  truth9b: Many bitter compounds are detected through GPCR signaling in taste receptor
    cells.
  truth10a: Taste receptor cells can release neurotransmitter onto afferent neurons.
  truth10b: Taste transduction ends with synaptic signaling to sensory neurons.
  truth11a: Signal amplification can occur when one activated receptor leads to many
    downstream second messengers.
  truth11b: A signaling cascade can amplify a small input into a larger cellular response.
  truth12a: Phosphodiesterase can terminate cyclic nucleotide signals by breaking
    down cAMP or cGMP.
  truth12b: Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases reduce signaling by hydrolyzing cyclic
    nucleotides.
false_statements:
  false1a: In mammals, olfactory receptors are ligand gated ion channels that open
    directly when an odorant binds.
  false1b: Most odorants are detected by receptor tyrosine kinases in olfactory neurons.
  false2a: In olfaction, odorant binding decreases cAMP by directly inhibiting adenylyl
    cyclase.
  false2b: Olfactory transduction primarily depends on cGMP made by guanylyl cyclase.
  false3a: In olfactory neurons, cAMP closes CNG channels to trigger depolarization.
  false3b: In olfaction, ion channels open only after cAMP is converted into cGMP.
  false4a: Each olfactory sensory neuron expresses many different olfactory receptor
    genes.
  false4b: A single olfactory sensory neuron expresses every odorant receptor type.
  false5a: Each odorant activates only one receptor, so smell has a one odor to one
    receptor code.
  false5b: Odor identity is determined only by odorant concentration, not by receptor
    patterns.
  false6a: Salty taste depends on GPCR activation of adenylyl cyclase and cAMP.
  false6b: Salty taste is primarily detected by nuclear hormone receptors in taste
    cells.
  false7a: Sour taste is caused by Na+ entering taste cells through ENaC channels.
  false7b: Sour tastants are detected because they increase pH inside taste receptor
    cells.
  false8a: Sweet tastants are detected mainly by direct passage of glucose through
    a membrane channel.
  false8b: Sweet taste is detected by a voltage gated sodium channel on taste cells.
  false9a: Bitter tastants are detected by the same receptor used for salty taste.
  false9b: Bitter taste occurs only when taste cells take up large amounts of Ca2+
    from food.
  false10a: Taste receptor cells do not communicate with neurons and act only as passive
    sensors.
  false10b: Taste transduction bypasses synapses and directly activates the cortex.
  false11a: Signal amplification means each signaling step reduces the number of activated
    molecules.
  false11b: A cascade is less sensitive because it prevents second messenger production.
  false12a: Phosphodiesterase makes cAMP from ATP and starts signaling.
  false12b: Phosphodiesterase increases cyclic nucleotide levels by synthesizing cAMP
    and cGMP.
