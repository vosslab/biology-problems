true_statements:
  truth1a: An individual olfactory sensory neuron usually expresses a single olfactory
    receptor gene.
  truth1b: A single olfactory sensory neuron typically expresses one receptor type.
  truth2a: Odor identity is encoded by patterns of activity across many olfactory
    receptor types.
  truth2b: Many odorants activate multiple receptors, producing a combinatorial code
    for odor identity.
  truth3a: Different odorants can be distinguished even when they share some receptors,
    because the overall activation pattern differs.
  truth3b: Odor discrimination can rely on different receptor activation patterns
    rather than a one odor to one receptor map.
  truth4a: Bitter taste is often encoded as an aversive category rather than many
    distinct bitter identities.
  truth4b: Bitter perception is frequently treated as a danger signal, so fine bitter
    identity is not strongly separated.
  truth5a: Many bitter sensing taste cells express multiple bitter receptors, which
    limits preservation of bitter identity at the periphery.
  truth5b: Coexpression of multiple bitter receptors in the same taste cells reduces
    the ability to label many separate bitter stimuli.
  truth6a: Taste coding often uses labeled line logic for categories like bitter,
    sweet, and umami.
  truth6b: Some taste qualities are carried by dedicated pathways that preserve category
    identity.
  truth7a: Olfaction supports high discrimination partly because many receptors contribute
    to identity coding.
  truth7b: Smell can distinguish many stimuli because odor identity depends on a large
    receptor repertoire and pattern coding.
  truth8a: Taste is commonly described using a small number of basic qualities (sweet,
    sour, salty, bitter, and umami).
  truth8b: Compared with smell, taste is organized into a few basic categories rather
    than many distinct identities.
false_statements:
  false1a: Each olfactory sensory neuron expresses many different olfactory receptor
    genes at the same time.
  false1b: Olfactory sensory neurons usually express all olfactory receptor genes.
  false2a: Each odorant activates only one olfactory receptor, so odor identity uses
    a one odor to one receptor code.
  false2b: Odor identity is determined mainly by odorant concentration, not by receptor
    activation patterns.
  false3a: Odor identity is lost before reaching the brain, so the brain receives
    only intensity information.
  false3b: Olfactory signals are mixed into a single channel before the brain, which
    prevents odor discrimination.
  false4a: Bitter taste discrimination is limited because bitter uses photoreceptors
    rather than chemoreceptors.
  false4b: Bitter taste does not use receptors and occurs only by diffusion into taste
    cells.
  false5a: Bitter taste discrimination is high because each bitter taste cell expresses
    only one bitter receptor.
  false5b: Bitter identity is preserved at the periphery by one receptor per cell
    logic.
  false6a: Taste categories are encoded only by intensity, not by which pathway is
    activated.
  false6b: Sweet and bitter activate the same dedicated pathway, so the brain cannot
    separate them.
  false7a: Olfaction is low discrimination because it relies on labeled line coding
    for a few odor categories.
  false7b: Smell uses only a small set of receptors, so most odorants activate the
    same receptor.
  false8a: Taste uses hundreds of receptor types to encode thousands of distinct taste
    identities like smell.
  false8b: Taste identity is primarily encoded by combinatorial patterns across many
    receptor types, like olfaction.
