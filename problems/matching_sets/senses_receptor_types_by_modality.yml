matching pairs:
  Vision:
    - Photoreceptors (rods and cones)
    - Photoreceptors that use opsins
    - Rod and cone photoreceptors (opsin + retinal)
  Smell (olfaction):
    - Olfactory sensory neurons (chemoreceptors; odorant receptors are GPCRs)
    - Olfactory receptor neurons (odorant GPCRs)
    - Olfactory sensory neurons that detect odorant molecules
  Taste (gustation):
    - Taste receptor cells in taste buds (chemoreceptors)
    - Taste receptor cells that detect chemicals in food
    - Taste receptor cells (GPCR pathways and ion channels)
  Hearing (audition):
    - Mechanoreceptors (cochlear hair cells)
    - Inner ear hair cells (mechanoreceptors)
    - Mechanoreceptors that respond to sound-driven deflection
  Balance (vestibular):
    - Mechanoreceptors (vestibular hair cells)
    - Vestibular hair cells (mechanoreceptors)
    - Mechanoreceptors that respond to head motion and gravity
  Touch (pressure, vibration):
    - Mechanoreceptors (skin, e.g., Pacinian corpuscles)
    - Cutaneous mechanoreceptors in skin
    - Cutaneous mechanoreceptors (many types; pressure and vibration)

exclude pairs:
  - [Hearing (audition), Balance (vestibular)]
