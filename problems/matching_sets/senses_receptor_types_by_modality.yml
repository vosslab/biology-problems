  Smell (olfaction):
    - Chemoreceptors (olfactory receptor neurons)
    - Chemoreceptors that detect volatile ligands
    - Olfactory GPCR-based chemoreceptors
  Taste (gustation):
    - Chemoreceptors (taste receptor cells in taste buds)
    - Chemoreceptors in taste buds
    - Taste receptor cells (chemoreceptors)
  Hearing (audition):
    - Mechanoreceptors (cochlear hair cells)
    - Inner ear hair cells (mechanoreceptors)
