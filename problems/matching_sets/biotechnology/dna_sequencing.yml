matching pairs:
  Classical Sanger sequencing:
    takes advantage that di-deoxynucleotide triphosphates terminate DNA strand elongation and molecules of different lengths can be separated on a gel
  Terminal-dye Sanger sequencing:
    detects fluorescently tagged di-deoxynucleotide triphosphates that terminate DNA strand elongation
  Roche 454 pyrosequencing:
    detects the light from the luciferase enzyme as it consumes the diphosphate molecules released when nucleotides are added to the DNA template
  ABI solid sequencing:
    detects sequences as they ligate to a di-base probe attached to a magnetic bead
  Illumina sequencing by synthesis:
    detects the light emitted from fluorescently tagged nucleotides as they are added to the DNA template
  Ion Torrent semiconductor sequencing:
    detects individual hydrogen ions released during DNA synthesis using microscopic pH meters
  PacBio single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing:
    detects a fluorescent tag on each nucleotide using a zero-mode waveguide with a single active DNA polymerase attached
  Oxford Nanopore sequencing:
    detects the electrical signal of nucleotides on a single-strand of DNA as it is pulled through a membrane protein channel
