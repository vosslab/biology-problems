matching pairs:
  DREB1A:
  - Enhances the plant's ability to retain water under drought conditions
  - Activates stress-responsive genes to help cope with arid environments
  - Primarily found in plants that are modified to thrive in drought-prone areas
  - Known for its role in enhancing abiotic stress tolerance, particularly drought
  - Increases the osmotic potential in plants, allowing them to survive longer without
    water
  Cry/Bt:
  - Functions by producing a protein toxic to specific insect larvae
  - Commonly utilized in crops like corn and cotton to reduce reliance on chemical
    pesticides
  - Is derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis
  - Binds to receptors in the insect gut, leading to cell lysis and death
  - Considered an environmentally friendly method for pest control as it reduces chemical
    pesticide use
  - Often integrated into plant genomes to produce Cry proteins throughout the plant's
    lifecycle
  AVP1:
  - Encodes a proton pump that helps plants tolerate salty environments
  - Increases root growth and biomass in transgenic plants
  - Plays a key role in vacuolar proton transport
  - Often engineered into plants that require high salt tolerance
  - Enhances water-use efficiency by increasing cellular ion retention
  - Associated with improved phosphorus uptake in plants
  aro A (Glyphosate Resistant):
  - Allows for resistance to glyphosate herbicides
  - Developed by transferring aro A gene into a glyphosate EPSP synthetase from Salmonella
    typhimurium and E. coli
  Mutant ALS (Sulphonylurea Resistant):
  - Encodes for a mutant acetolactate synthetase that allows for resistance to Sulphonylurea
    herbicides
  - Originates from Arabidopsis
  QB Protein (Atrazine Resistant):
  - Derived from mutant Amaranthus hybrids
  - Produces atrazine-resistant transgenic plants
  TMV Coat Proteins (Virus Resistant):
  - Provides resistance against Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV)
  - Developed by introducing viral coat proteins
  Beta-Carotene Genes (Nutritional Benefits):
  - Increases production of beta-carotene as a precursor to vitamin A
  - Derived from daffodils and microorganisms
  Salt Tolerance Gene (from Mangroves):
  - Provides salt tolerance
  - Derived from Avicennia marina
  gut D Gene (Salt Tolerance):
  - Used to generate salt-tolerant transgenic maize plants
  - Originates from Escherichia coli
  Therapeutic Proteins:
  - Produces antibodies, proteins, or vaccines for therapeutic use
  - Could be useful for various diseases ranging from dental caries to certain cancers
  Enhanced Shelf Life Genes:
  - Provides enhanced ability to withstand long-distance transportation
  - Allows for longer shelf life of produce
