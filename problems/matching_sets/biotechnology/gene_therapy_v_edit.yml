matching pairs:
  gene therapy:
  - treating cystic fibrosis using adenovirus to introduce a functioning protein channel
  - engineering virus for injection into a tumor to promote apoptosis
  - introducing a new gene on a plasmid into a patient to replace a faulty &beta;-thalassemia
    enzyme
  - culture and reprogram blood progenitor cells from bone marrow to kill HIV-infected
    cells
  - mRNA vaccines express the viral spike proteins to train the immune system to recognize
    the virus
  genome editing:
  - using CRISPR to change a single nucleotide in sickle-cell allele
  - deleting the fragments of HIV DNA from the genome of an infected patient
  - correcting a mutation within the host genome that causes liver disease
  - using zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) mediated treatment to replace a nucleotide in
    the diseased &beta;-thalassemia allele
  - using transcriptor activator-like effector nuclease (TALENs) to correct inherited
    retinal dystrophy
  - CRISPR is used to insert a functional micro-dystrophin gene correcting Duchenne
    muscular dystrophy (DMD)
  - correct defective DNA elements within a gene
