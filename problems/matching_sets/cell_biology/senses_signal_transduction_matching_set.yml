matching pairs:
  Olfactory receptor (GPCR):
    - Receptor that binds odorants and activates G proteins
    - GPCR that initiates olfactory signaling in sensory neurons
    - Odorant-activated GPCR upstream of cAMP production
  G<sub>olf</sub>:
    - Olfactory G protein that activates adenylyl cyclase
    - G protein coupling olfactory receptors to cAMP signaling
    - Heterotrimeric G protein used in olfactory GPCR pathways
  Adenylyl cyclase (AC3):
    - Enzyme that converts ATP to cAMP in olfactory neurons
    - Enzyme that produces cAMP as a second messenger
    - ATP-to-cAMP enzyme downstream of G<sub>olf</sub>
  cAMP:
    - Second messenger made from ATP that rises during odor detection
    - Signaling molecule that helps open olfactory CNG channels
    - Cytosolic second messenger produced downstream of olfactory GPCRs
  CNG channel (olfactory):
    - Ion channel opened by cyclic nucleotides during odor detection
    - Cyclic nucleotide gated channel that depolarizes olfactory neurons
    - Allows Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry that can amplify the olfactory response
  Gustducin:
    - Taste G protein used in bitter and sweet pathways
    - G protein that couples taste GPCRs to downstream second messengers
    - Heterotrimeric G protein in taste receptor signaling
  Phospholipase C-&beta;2 (PLC-&beta;2):
    - Enzyme that cleaves PIP<sub>2</sub> to generate IP<sub>3</sub>
    - PIP<sub>2</sub>-cleaving enzyme in bitter, sweet, and umami taste signaling
    - Enzyme that produces IP<sub>3</sub> downstream of taste GPCRs
  IP<sub>3</sub>:
    - Second messenger that triggers Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from ER stores
    - Diffusible messenger that raises cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in taste cells
    - Molecule that opens IP<sub>3</sub> receptors on internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores
  TRPM5:
    - Cation channel activated downstream of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in taste cells
    - Channel that helps depolarize taste receptor cells after GPCR activation
    - Ion channel involved in taste transduction downstream of IP<sub>3</sub>
  Rhodopsin:
    - Opsin plus retinal that activates transducin when retinal isomerizes
    - Light-activated GPCR in rod photoreceptors
    - Photopigment that starts rod phototransduction
  Transducin:
    - G protein that activates PDE6 in rod phototransduction
    - Rod G protein linking rhodopsin to cGMP breakdown
    - Heterotrimeric G protein in the visual cascade
  Phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6):
    - Enzyme that hydrolyzes cGMP in rods after light activation
    - Enzyme that lowers cGMP concentration during phototransduction
    - cGMP-degrading enzyme downstream of transducin
  cGMP:
    - Second messenger that keeps rod CNG channels open in the dark
    - Signaling nucleotide that falls in light, closing CNG channels
    - Cyclic nucleotide that gates rod outer segment ion channels
  CNG channel (rod outer segment):
    - Ion channel that closes when cGMP falls, hyperpolarizing the rod
    - cGMP-gated channel that is open in darkness and closes in light
    - Rod channel controlled by cGMP levels
  Tip link (hair cell bundle):
    - Mechanical tether that transmits force to open mechanotransduction channels
    - Link between stereocilia that helps gate transduction channels
    - Structure whose tension changes during stereocilia deflection
  Mechanotransduction channel (hair cell MET channel):
    - Ion channel opened by stereocilia deflection in hearing and balance
    - Mechanically gated channel that allows cation influx in hair cells
    - Allows K<sup>+</sup> influx from K<sup>+</sup> rich endolymph to depolarize hair cells

exclude pairs:
  - [cAMP, cGMP]
  - [CNG channel (olfactory), CNG channel (rod outer segment)]
