matching pairs:
  desmosome:
  - a dense attachment of anchoring proteins that a provide strong adhesion between
    cells
  - an adhesive junction that is crucial to tissues that experience mechanical stress
  - anchoring spots found all around cells that bind two adjacent cells together
  - one of the stronger junctions found in tissue that experience intense mechanical
    stress
  gap junction:
  - collection of protein channels that allow the direct transfer of signal molecules
    between cells
  - collection of protein channels that facilitates passage of ions, hormones, and
    neurotransmitters
  - collection of protein channels that allow for intercellular communication
  - two adjacent cells are connected through a collection of protein channels
  - collection of protein channels that directly connect the cytoplasm of two adjacent
    cells
  - collection of protein channels that allow electrical impulses to directly pass
    between cells
  plasmodesmata:
  - large tubes which traverse cell walls enabling transport and communication between
    cells
  - large tubes that pass through openings in cell walls linking one cell to another
  tight junction:
  - forms a seal between the two membranes to prevent passive flow between cells
  - membranes join together forming a virtual impermeable barrier to fluid
  - areas where the membranes of two adjacent cells join together to form a barrier
  - parallel interweaving strands between two membranes that greatly reduce the flow
    of macromolecules between cells
  - outer layers of the cell membranes are fused, reducing the ability of larger molecules
    to pass between
  - closely associated areas of two adjacent cells whose membranes join together to
    form a virtually impermeable barrier to fluid
  - seal between the membranes of two adjacent cells to prevent leakage of solutes
    and water
  - connections formed by cells that fuse together so that a relatively impermeable
    barrier is created
