learning_objective: Match each taste quality to a canonical stimulus example.

items to match per question: 4

#Author notes (biology-first, deduction-based):
#- Values should be short biological cues, not just molecule names.
#- Each value should include (a) a chemical/class cue and (b) a familiar example/source.
#- Do not include taste words (sweet/sour/salty/bitter/savory) in the values.
#- For Sweet values, avoid the substring "sugar" anywhere; use carbohydrate/saccharide terms instead.
#- Put synonyms/alternate phrasings under the same key so a student sees only one per question,
#  but different generated questions rotate through variants.

matching pairs:
  Sweet:
    - a monosaccharide such as glucose, a common fuel for glycolysis
    - a disaccharide such as sucrose, common in table sucrose products
    - a fruit hexose such as fructose, common in ripe fruit
    - a milk disaccharide such as lactose, common in dairy
    - a starch breakdown product such as maltose
    - small carbohydrates absorbed in the small intestine
    - simple saccharides commonly used as cellular energy sources
  Umami:
    - free glutamate released from protein rich foods during fermentation
    - the amino acid glutamate concentrated in aged cheeses and soy sauce
    - a protein hydrolysis product that increases free glutamate
    - monosodium glutamate, a salt form of the amino acid glutamate used in seasoning
    - L-glutamate released when proteins are broken down during digestion
    - MSG added to foods as a glutamate source
  Sour:
    - high proton concentration, low pH, typical of lemon juice
    - organic acids that donate protons, such as citric acid in citrus
    - acetic acid from vinegar, a proton donor that lowers pH
    - lactic acid from fermented dairy, increasing acidity
    - increased H3O+ concentration in an acidic solution
    - protons (H+) that lower pH in foods and drinks
  Salty:
    - high sodium ion concentration from dissolved NaCl in snack foods
    - sodium ions released when sodium chloride dissolves in saliva
    - a sodium rich brine solution used to preserve foods like pickles
    - electrolyte sodium ions common in broths and cured foods
    - Na+ in solution from added sodium chloride
    - foods with high sodium chloride content
  Bitter:
    - quinine alkaloids from plant defense chemistry, present in tonic water
    - basic nitrogen containing alkaloids such as caffeine in coffee or tea
    - plant defensive toxins, often alkaloids, that deter herbivores
    - an alkaloid poison such as strychnine used historically as pesticide
    - nicotine, a plant alkaloid that acts as an insect deterrent
    - denatonium, a compound used to discourage accidental ingestion
