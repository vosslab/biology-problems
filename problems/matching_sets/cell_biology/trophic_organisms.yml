matching pairs:
  photolithoautotroph:
  - uses light for energy and CO<sub>2</sub> as a carbon&nbsp;source
  - uses light for energy and carbon&nbsp;dioxide as a carbon&nbsp;source
  - obtains energy from light and its organic material is derived from carbon&nbsp;dioxide
  chemolithoautotroph:
  - obtains energy by oxidizing inorganic compounds
  - uses inorganic compounds for both energy and carbon&nbsp;source
  - uses sulfur, iron, or nitrogen as energy sources and carbon&nbsp;dioxide as a
    carbon&nbsp;source
  chemoorganoheterotroph:
  - derives its energy using organic chemicals from consuming other organisms
  - uses organic compounds for both energy and its carbon&nbsp;source
  chemolithoheterotroph:
  - its energy from the oxidation of inorganic compounds, but uses organic compounds
    as its carbon&nbsp;source
  - derives its energy using inorganic chemicals, but its carbon from other organisms
  - uses inorganic compounds for energy, but uses organic compounds as its carbon&nbsp;source
  - uses sulfur, iron, or nitrogen as energy sources, but uses organic compounds from
    other organisms as its carbon&nbsp;source
  photoorganoheterotroph:
  - obtains energy from light and organic material from other organisms
  - obtains energy from light and organic material as its carbon&nbsp;source
  - uses energy from light and organic material from other organisms
  - relys on light for energy and organic compounds from other organisms for survival
  - uses light for energy, but requires organic compounds from other organisms to
    provide the carbon it needs
