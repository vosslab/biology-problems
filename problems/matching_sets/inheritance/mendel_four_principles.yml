  Principle_of_Paired_Factors:
  - Each organism has two alleles that make up the genotype for a given trait.
  - Character is represented in an organism by two alleles.
  - For a given characteristic, each trait consists of two alleles.
  - Each organism has two alleles for each gene.
  - Genotypes for specific traits are determined by two alleles.
  - Two alleles contribute to an organism's characteristic.
  - An organism possesses two alleles for each specific trait.
  - The genetic makeup for a particular characteristic in an organism involves two
    alleles.
  - A single trait in an organism is influenced by two alleles.
  - The presence of two alleles accounts for each trait in an organism.
  - An organism has two alleles that make up the genotype for a specific trait.
  - Each trait in an organism is determined by two alleles.
  - Two alleles define each specific trait in an organism.
  - Two alleles determine a single trait in the offspring.
  - Each organism has two alleles that influence a given characteristic.
  - For every characteristic, an organism possesses two alleles.
  - The genetic makeup for each character involves two alleles.
  Principle_of_Dominance:
  - Out of the two different alleles for the same gene, only one is able to express
    its effect.
  - For each character there is a dominant allele, the trait is determined by that
    allele.
  - For each genotype there is a dominant allele, the phenotype is determined by that
    allele.
  - Recessive alleles are not expressed in the phenotype of the hybrid organism.
  - Dominant alleles are the ones that determine the phenotype of the hybrid organism.
  - Some alleles are dominant, which means that their phenotype will mask the recessive
    phenotype.
  - Dominant alleles mask the expression of their recessive counterparts.
  - In cases where contrasting alleles are present, the dominant allele determines
    the phenotype.
  - Dominant alleles express their effects even when present in just a single copy.
  - If contrasting alleles are present, the dominant one determines the phenotype.
  - Presence of a dominant allele overrides the expression of the recessive allele.
  - When different alleles exist, the dominant alleles determines the organism's traits.
  - In a set of differing alleles, one will usually mask the effect of the other.
  - When two different alleles are present, one usually determines the observable
    traits.
  - One allele's traits will often be expressed over another allele's when both are
    present.
  - The observable traits with mixed alleles are usually determined by one dominant
    allele.
  - When different alleles are present, the effect of one will generally dominate.
  Law_of_Segregation:
  - Each parent contributes just one of their two alleles to its offspring.
  - Two factors of a character get randomly distributed to different gametes.
  - When the gametes are formed, the factors separate and are distributed as units
    to each gamete.
  - Allele pairs separate during the formation of gametes.
  - Two alleles for each trait separate during the formation of gametes.
  - A gamete carries only one allele for a gene but not both the alleles.
  - Pairs of alleles separate during gamete formation.
  - During gamete formation, allele pairs are separated into individual gametes.
  - Each parent passes a single allele for each trait to the offspring during sexual
    reproduction.
  - One allele from each gene pair is transmitted to an individual gamete.
  - During the creation of gametes, alleles are distributed individually.
  - Alleles from each parent are separated into individual gametes.
  - During the creation of gametes, each parent contributes a single allele for each
    characteristic.
  - A gamete carries just one of the two alleles for each characteristic.
  - Two alleles for a character are randomly distributed into different gametes.
  Law_of_Independent_Assortment:
  - Two different characters will be inherited separately from each other.
  - Inheritance of genes at one location does not influence the inheritance of genes
    at another location.
  - The segregation of one gene pair doesn't affect the segregation of another.
  - Inheritance patterns for one trait do not interfere with those of another trait.
  - The segregation of one pair of alleles is not influenced by another pair.
  - Traits from different genes are passed down separately from one another.
  - The inheritance of one gene has no bearing on the inheritance of another gene
    located at a different location.
  - Genes at one location have no impact on the inheritance of genes at a separate
    location.
  - The factors affecting one characteristic don't alter the factors affecting another
    characteristic during gamete creation.
  - Traits inherited from different genes do not influence each other.
  - Sorting one pair of alleles into gametes does not alter the sorting of another
    pair of alleles.
  - No connection exists between the inheritance patterns of one trait and those of
    a different trait.
  - During the creation of gametes, the grouping of one set of alleles doesn't affect
    the grouping of another set.
  - Each pair of traits is passed down without any impact on the passage of other
    pairs during the creation of gametes.
  - The inheritance of one gene does not impact the inheritance of another separate
    gene.
  - The inheritance of one trait doesn't influence the inheritance of another.
  - Alleles for different traits are passed down without influencing each other.
  - Traits from separate genes do not affect each other during the reproductive process.
  - In the process of forming gametes, each set of alleles sorts without impacting
    another set.
  - The inheritance of one set of alleles has no impact on another set.
