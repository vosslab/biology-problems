matching pairs:
  haploid:
  - a cell or organism that a single set of chromosomes
  diploid:
  - a cell or organism that has paired chromosomes
  'gene ':
  - the unit of inheritance passed from parents to offspring
  - the main elements of heredity
  genetics:
  - the study of heredity and the variation of inherited characteristics
  - the study of the effect of genetic differences on organisms
  - study of genes, genetic variation, and heredity in organisms
  - scientific study of how genes control the characteristics of plants and animals
  - study of both trait and molecular inheritance mechanisms of genes
  - the study of heredity and how genes control the inherited characteristics
  genetic code:
  - the set of instructions that tell a cell how to make a specific protein
  - the set of rules used by living cells to translate information encoded within
    genetic material into proteins
  - the set of instructions that converts the sequence of nucleotides into an amino
    acid sequence in proteins
  - the code our body uses to convert the instructions contained in our DNA the essential
    materials of life
  genomics:
  - the study of all of the genes in an organism
  - the structure, function, evolution, and mapping of genomes
  'genome ':
  - an organism's complete set of DNA
  - complete set of DNA in an organism
  - complete set of DNA in a cell or organism
  locus:
  - location of a gene on a chromosome
  - where on a chromosome a specific gene is located
  - a specific, fixed position on a chromosome of a particular gene
  - a spot or "address" on a chromosome at which a gene for a particular trait is
    located
  - the physical position of a gene within a chromosome
  single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP):
  - variation resulting from a single base pair change
  - most common type of genetic variation among people
  - a genomic variant at a single base position in the DNA
  - a substitution of a single nucleotide at a specific position in the genome
  homologous chromosomes:
  - two similar but different copies of a chromosome
  - one chromosome from the mother and one chromosome from the father
  - two chromosomes which carry the same genes, one from each parental source
  - chromosomes which contain the same genes in the same order along their chromosomal
    arms
  - chromosomes of similar length, gene position, and centromere location
  - two chromosomes containing identical genetic loci although possibly different
    allelic forms
