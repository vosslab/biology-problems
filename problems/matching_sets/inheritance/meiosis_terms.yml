matching pairs:
  homologous chromosomes:
  - two similar but different copies of a chromosome
  - one chromosome from the mother and one chromosome from the father
  - two chromosomes which carry the same genes, one from each parental source
  - chromosomes which contain the same genes in the same order along their chromosomal
    arms
  - chromosomes of similar length, gene position, and centromere location
  - two chromosomes containing identical genetic loci although possibly different
    allelic forms
  - chromosome pairs (one from each parent) that are similar in length, gene position,
    and centromere location
  homologousx:
  - not an exact copy but having the same structural features and pattern of genes
  - corresponding or similar in position, value, structure, or function
  - similar in structure and evolutionary origin, though not necessarily in function
  - corresponding or alike in certain critical attributes
  - denoting organs or parts corresponding in evolutionary origin and similar to some
    extent in structure
  - having a similar position, structure, value, or purpose
  synapsis:
  - process of pairing of homologous (maternal and paternal) chromosomes
  - the lengthwise pairing of homologous chromosomes
  - the joining of the two homologous chromosomes
  - the matching-up of homologous pairs prior to their segregation
  - homologous chromosomes pair with their counterparts and remain bound
  - pairing of homologous chromosomes prior to their separation into daughter cells
  sister chromatids:
  - two identical copies of a single replicated chromosome joined at the centromere
  - two identical copies of the same chromosome formed by DNA replication
  - two identical copies of the same chromosome attached to each other by the centromere
  - a single duplicated chromosome with a common centromere
  - identical copies (chromatids) of a chromosome formed by DNA replication
  - two identical copies of a chromosome joined together by a common centromere
  - two identical chromatids that are formed by replication of a chromosome
  - two identical copies of one chromosome specifically created for cell division
  crossing over:
  - the exchange of genes between homologous chromosomes, resulting in a mixture of
    parental characteristics
  - two homologous chromosomes line up and parts of the chromosomes can be exchanged
  - the exchange of genes between two homologous chromosomes, resulting in a mixture
    of parental characteristics
  - the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes
  - the actual exchange of segments between homologous chromosomes
  - a process by which parts of homologous chromosomes are interchanged
  chiasmata:
  - the physical link between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes that
    remain after crossing over
  - the point of contact between paired chromatids that marks a crossover site
  - specialized chromatin structures that link homologous chromosomes together
  - the visible link between two (non-sister) chromatids belonging to homologous chromosomes
  - the region where homologous chromosomes stay connected after crossing over
  - a point of overlap of paired chromatids at which exchange of genetic material
    has taken place
