matching pairs:
  X-Y system:
  - xmales are heterogametic and females are homogametic
  - females are homogametic and xmales are heterogametic
  - sex is determined by which chromosome is contained in the xmale sperm cell
  - found in most mammals, as well as some insects including <i>Drosophila</i>
  - xmales have two different kinds of sex chromosomes
  - females have two of the same kind of sex chromosome
  - sex of an offspring depends on which of two sex chromosomes are contained with
    the xmale sperm
  X-O system:
  - xmales are diploid, but only have one sex chromosome
  - xmales only have one sex chromosome, while females have two
  - females have two homologous sex chromosomes, xmales have only one
  - sex is determined on whether or not the xmale sperm contains a sex chromosome
  - found in a number of insects, including the grasshoppers, cockroaches, and crickets
  - sex of the offspring depends on whether or not a sex chromosome is present in
    the xmale sperm
  - sex of the offspring depends on whether or not a sex chromosome is present in
    the xmale gamete
  - xmale sperm normally contain either one sex chromosome or no sex chromosomes at
    all
  - sex of an offspring depends on if the xmale sperm contains a sex chromosome or
    if it is missing
  Z-W system:
  - females are heterogametic and xmales are homogametic
  - xmales are homogametic and females are heterogametic
  - sex of an offspring depends on which sex chromosome is contained with the female
    egg (ovum)
  - sex is determined by the type of sex chromosome in the egg (ovum)
  - found in most birds, many reptiles, and some insects
  - this system is the reverse of the system found in humans
  - females have two different kinds of sex chromosomes
  - xmales have two of the same kind of sex chromosomes
  - xmales have two of the same sex chromosomes
  Haplo-Diploid system:
  - xmales develop from unfertilized eggs and thus have no fathers
  - only system where xmales have no fathers
  - xmales only have one copy of every chromosome
  - xmales carry only one copy of each chromosome
  - found in insects, such as ants and bees
  - unfertilized eggs develop into xmales
  - sex is based on whether or not the female egg (ovum) is exposed to sperm
  - there are no sex chromosomes
  - fertilized eggs (with sperm) develop into females, unfertilized eggs develop into
    xmales
