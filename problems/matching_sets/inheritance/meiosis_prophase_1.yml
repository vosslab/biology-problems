matching pairs:
  Leptotene:
  - chromosomes begin to condense
  - thread-like chromomeres become visible along the chromosomes
  - chromosomes first become visible as thin thread-like structures
  - chromosomes first appear as fine discrete threads
  - chromomeres appear as bead-like thickenings along the chromosomes
  - condensation begins and chromosomes become visible as thin threads
  Zygotene:
  - synapsis begins
  - the pairing of homologous chromosomes begins
  - the synapsis process forms numerous points of contact between homologs
  - stage where homologous chromosomes become paired
  - homologous chromosomes align and pair
  - synapsis of homologous chromosomes occurs
  - strands of homologous chromosomes line up and become pairs
  Pachytene, early or late:
  - synapsis is complete
  - the pairing of homologous chromosomes is complete
  - crossing over occurs between non-sister chromatids
  - crossing over occurs between homologous chromosomes
  - exchange of segments between non-sister chromatids may occur
  - exchange of segments between homologous chromosomes may occur
  - chromosomes continue to shorten and thicken
  Diplotene or Diakinesis, combined:
  - the paired chromosomes begin to separate
  - chiasmata are visible between homologous chromosomes
  - homologous chromosomes begin to migrate apart
  - homologous chromosome pairs begin to separate and chiasmata become visible
  - homologous chromosomes separate and chiasmata become visible
  - homologous chromosomes are held together only by the chiasmata
  - chromosomes become further condensed
  - chromosomes reach near-maximal condensation in late prophase I
  - nucleolus and nuclear envelope disappear while spindle fibers form
