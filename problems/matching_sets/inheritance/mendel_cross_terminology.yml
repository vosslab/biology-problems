matching pairs:
  test&nbsp;cross:
  - a type of cross where the dominant phenotype is crossed with the homozygous recessive
    genotype
  - a type of cross that uses a homozygous recessive organism to determine the genetic
    makeup of another dominant organism
  - a type of cross involving an individual which is homozygous recessive for all
    genes of interest
  - a type of cross involving an individuals with a dominant phenotype and an unknown
    genotype, mated with a homozygous recessive individual
  - a type of cross where a test organism showing a dominant trait is crossed with
    one showing all recessive traits
  - a type of cross between a homozygous recessive individual with an individual of
    an unknown dominant genotype
  - a type of cross of an individual of dominant phenotype and unknown genotype and
    an individual with a homozygous recessive genotype
  - a genetic cross in which a dominant phenotype is paired with a homozygous recessive
    genotype
  - a genetic cross to identify the genotype of an organism with a dominant phenotype
    by crossing it with a homozygous recessive individual
  - a cross used to determine whether an individual with a dominant trait is homozygous
    or heterozygous
  - a cross to uncover the genotype of an individual with the dominant phenotype by
    mating it with a homozygous recessive organism
  - a cross designed to reveal the genotype of a dominant phenotype individual by
    pairing it with a homozygous recessive individual
  backcross:
  - a type of cross where F<sub>1</sub> hybrids are crossed with one of the parental
    genotypes
  - a type of cross when F<sub>1</sub> individuals are crossed with one of the two
    parents
  - a cross involving F<sub>1</sub> hybrids and one of their parental genotypes
  - a mating event where F<sub>1</sub> individuals are bred with one of the original
    parental types
  - a genetic cross to trace the inheritance of a specific trait back to one of the
    original parents
  - a genetic cross that involves the F<sub>1</sub> generation being mated with one
    of the parent types
  hybrid&nbsp;cross:
  - a type of cross between two individuals who have distinct homozygous genotypes
  - a type of cross between two true-breeding individuals with different phenotypes
  - a type of cross that mates two true-breeding individuals with different phenotypes
  - a genetic cross between two homozygous individuals with different traits
  - a cross involving two true-breeding organisms with distinct traits
  - a mating event that pairs two homozygous individuals with different characteristics
  - a genetic cross to combine traits from two different true-breeding parents
  - a cross between two true-breeding organisms that each display distinct, homozygous
    traits
  - a cross that brings together two true-breeding individuals who are homozygous
    for different sets of traits
  reciprocal&nbsp;cross:
  - a type of cross designed to test the role of parental sex on a given inheritance
    pattern
  - two separate crosses where the traits of the male and female in one cross are
    switched in another cross
  - a genetic cross that examines the impact of parental sex on inheritance patterns
  - two distinct mating events where male and female traits are swapped between the
    crosses
  - a pair of crosses that reverses the sexes associated with specific traits
  - a set of two crosses to investigate if the sex of the parent influences the inheritance
    of traits
  - two distinct crosses where the male and female parental traits are reversed in
    the subsequent cross
  - two paired crosses that switch the roles of male and female parents to investigate
    the influence of parental sex on trait inheritance
