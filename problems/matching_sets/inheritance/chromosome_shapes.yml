matching pairs:
  Acentric:
  - an abnormal chromosome that lacks a centromerex
  - spindle fibers cannot attach and the chromosome is lost when the cell divides
  - an unstable chromosome lacking spindle fiber attachment
  - an unstable chromosome with no centromerex
  - an unstable chromosome lacking a centromerex
  Acrocentric:
  - the short arm of the chromosome is so short that it is hard to observe
  - the chromosome most resembles the letter V during metaphase before anaphase separation
  - the centromere is located very close to one end of the chromosomex
  - the chromosome most resembles the letter I after anaphase separation
  - the centromere is closer to the end rather than the center
  - the centromere is very offset from the center leading to a very short arm
  - a chromosome with one very long arm and one very short arm
  Dicentric:
  - an abnormal chromosome that has two centromeres that often appear in cancer cells
  - an abnormal chromosome with two centromeres that often appear in cancer cells
  - an unstable chromosome due to unpredictable spindle fiber attachment
  - a chromosome with formed through the fusion of two chromosome segments, each with
    a centromerex
  - genomic rearrangements placing two centromeres on the same chromosomex
  Metacentric:
  - the two arms of the chromosomes are almost equal
  - the chromosome most resembles the letter V after anaphase separation
  - the chromosome most resembles a perfect letter X during metaphase
  - the centromere is located midway between the ends of the chromosomex
  - a chromosome with a centromere placed in the center
  - the centromere divides the chromosome into two arms with equal length
  - a chromosome with two arms of equal length
  Submetacentric:
  - the chromosome most resembles the letter J after anaphase separation
  - a chromosome with slightly shorter p arm relative to q arm
  - the centromere situated so that one arm is somewhat shorter than the other
  - a slight asymmetry in the length of the two chromosome arms
  - the centromere slightly offset from the center
