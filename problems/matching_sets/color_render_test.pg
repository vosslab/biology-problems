BEGIN_PGML
Color rendering tests (same page, multiple methods).

1) Literal TeX in PGML math brackets (should work if MathJax processes PGML math):
[\color{#cc00cc}{\text{BRACKET TeX magenta}}]

2) Literal TeX using \textcolor (sometimes available, depends on MathJax extensions):
[\textcolor{#009900}{\text{BRACKET textcolor green}}]

3) Literal TeX with \( \) delimiters typed directly (often fails if treated as text):
\(\color{#cc00cc}{\text{PAREN TeX magenta}}\)

4) PGML tag wrapper with CSS class (no MathJax needed, should work if span tags are allowed):
[<CSS class magenta>]{['span', class => 'css-magenta']}{['','']}

5) PGML tag wrapper with inline style (no MathJax needed):
[<Inline style green>]{['span', style => 'color:#009900;font-weight:700;']}{['','']}

6) Variable inserted TeX-like string (in your setup this has been getting tex2jax_ignore, so this should show literal backslashes):
[$var_tex]

How to read the results:
	•	If (1) renders colored, MathJax is working on PGML math, and you can use the “TeX is literal in PGML math” approach.
	•	If (4) and (5) render colored but (1) does not, then MathJax coloring is a dead end on your install and CSS is the reliable path.
	•	If none of them render colored, something is sanitizing styles and MathJax, and we need to look at site configuration.

Your earlier dumps strongly suggest (6) will fail, and the goal is to discover whether (1) works and whether CSS wrappers (4)/(5) are permitted.
