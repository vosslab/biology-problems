matching pairs:
  Substrate:
  - a molecule (reactant) that is acted upon by an enzyme
  - a molecule that is transformed into a product by an enzyme
  Reagent:
  - a molecule that facilitates a chemical reaction
  - a substance that participates in a chemical reaction
  - substance used to cause or facilitate a chemical reaction
  - can be either reactants or catalysts that play a role in a chemical reaction
  Reactant:
  - a molecule that is consumed by a chemical reaction
  - substance that is transformed into one or more chemical products.
  Product:
  - something manufactured by an enzyme from its substrate
  - any substance that is produced as a result of a chemical reaction
  Transition state:
  - intermediate, short-lived, high energy state of the substrate before forming the
    product
  - an intermediate, high-energy stage in a chemical reaction
  Enzyme:
  - proteins that catalyze chemical reactions
  - proteins that increase the rate of reactions
  Ribozyme:
  - RNA molecules that catalyze chemical reactions
  - nucleic acids that can catalyze chemical reactions
  Active site:
  - part of an enzyme where substrates bind and undergo a chemical reaction
  - specific region where substrate molecules bind and undergo a chemical reaction
  - a site on an enzyme designed for precise interactions with the substrate
  - part of an enzyme that provides the environment necessary for the chemical reaction
    to occur
  Ligand:
  - any substance that forms a complex with a biomolecule to serve a biological purpose
  - usually a small molecule, such as a hormone, neurotransmitter, or drug, that binds
    to a protein
  Ligand-binding site:
  - location on biomolecule where an important small molecule binds
  - binding site on the enzyme that can alter its activity and is often a target for
    drugs
  Cofactor:
  - non-protein small molecules that some enzymes require for activity
  - non-protein substances required for enzyme activity
  - either metallic ions or small organic molecules required for enzyme activity
  Coenzyme:
  - organic molecules derived from vitamins
  - organic molecules required for enzyme activity
  Prosthetic group:
  - tightly bound coenzymes
  - organic molecules tightly bound to an enzyme
  Holoenzyme:
  - enzyme with bound cofactors
  - protein along with one or more cofactors
  - a complete enzyme complex
  Apoenzyme:
  - enzyme without its cofactors
  - an inactive enzyme that missing its cofactors
exclude pairs:
- - Coenzyme
  - Cofactor
- - Coenzyme
  - Prosthetic group
- - Cofactor
  - Prosthetic group
- - Ligand
  - Ligand-binding site
