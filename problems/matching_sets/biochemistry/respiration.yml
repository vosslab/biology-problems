matching pairs:
  Glycolysis:
  - First stage of cellular respiration
  - For each molecule of glucose, this stage produces two (2) ATP and two (2) NADH
    molecules
  - The only stage of cellular respiration that takes place in the cytosol of the
    cell
  Pyruvate&nbsp;Oxidation:
  - Short stage that produces carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and NADH
  - Takes pyruvate as input and produces acetyl-CoA
  - A stage that links glycolysis to the rest of cellular respiration
  - Pyruvate must enter the mitochondrial matrix for this stage to begin
  - This stage is entirely carried out by a large enzyme complex called the pyruvate
    dehydrogenase complex
  - For each molecule of glucose, this stage produces zero (0) ATP and two (2) NADH
    molecules
  - First stage of cellular respiration that occurs within the mitochondria organelles
  Cirtic Acid Cycle (TCA cycle):
  - Starts by joining a four carbon sugar and a two carbon sugar
  - Forms a GTP molecule which is equivalent to an ATP molecule
  - Final stage in the oxidation of glucose into carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)
  - Acetyl CoA serves as fuel for this stage of cellular respiration
  - This stage was identified by Hans Krebs and William Johnson in 1937 and is sometimes
    called the "Krebs cycle"
  - Begins with the transfer of a two-carbon acetyl group to a four-carbon acceptor
    to form a six-carbon compound
  - Begins with the transfer of a two-carbon acetyl CoA to a four-carbon oxaloacetate
    to form a six-carbon citrate
  - The only stage of cellular respiration that produces the electron acceptor FADH<sub>2</sub>
  - At the end this stage, the four-carbon oxaloacetate has been regenerated, and
    the stage repeats.
  - For each molecule of glucose, this stage produces two (2) ATP, six (6) NADH, and
    two (2) FADH<sub>2</sub> molecules
  Electron Transport Chain (ETC):
  - Stage of cellular respiration that extracts energy from the electron carriers
    NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub>
  - Occurs in the membrane of the mitochondrial matrix to produce the electrochemical
    gradient
  - Involves a series of protein complexes to extract redox energy from the high energy
    electrons
  Chemiosmosis:
  - Stage of cellular respiration that produces the most ATP
  - Occurs in the membrane of the mitochondrial matrix to produce ATP
  - Uses the electrochemical gradient to produce substrate-level phosphorylation energy
    molecules
  - The protein ATP synthase works like a water turbine in a dam
  - The only stage of cellular respiration that does NOT involve electron carriers
