matching pairs:
  glycogen:
  - storage form of glucose in animals
  - animal polysaccharide that contains &alpha;-glycosidic linkages
  - animal molecule composed of linear chains of &alpha;-(1,4) D-glucose residues
    connected through &alpha;-(1,6) linkages
  - glucose storage found in skeleton muscle and liver cells
  - highly branched polymer of &alpha;-linked glucose units found in animals
  - highly branched energy storage in animals
  amylopectin:
  - branched storage form of glucose in plants
  - highly branched polymer of &alpha;-linked glucose units found in plants
  - highly branched glucose polymer found in plants that is readily digested by humans
    and other mammals
  - plant molecule composed of linear chains of &alpha;-(1,4) D-glucose residues connected
    through &alpha;-(1,6) linkages
  - moderately branched energy storage in plants
  amylose:
  - unbranched storage form of glucose in plants
  - unbranched energy storage in plants
  - linear chain of glucose with &alpha;-glycosidic linkages and no branches
  - also know as resistant starch, because it has no branches and it is resistant
    to digestion
  chitin:
  - structural form of glucose in some animals
  - animal polysaccharide that contains &beta;-glycosidic linkages
  - major structural component of arthopod (e.g., insects) exoskeletons
  - polymer of &beta;-linked glucose units found in some animals
  - carbohydrate polymer that used for structural purposes by some animals
  - structural material in arthropods and fungi
  cellulose:
  - structural form of glucose in plants
  - major structural component of cell walls
  - plant polysaccharide that contains &beta;-glycosidic linkages
  - polymer of &beta;-linked glucose units found in plants
  - carbohydrate polymer that used for structural purposes by plants
  - structural material in plant cell walls
