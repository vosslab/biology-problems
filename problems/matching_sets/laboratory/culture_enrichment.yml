matching pairs:
  stable isotope probing (SIP):
  - adding heavy isotopes to an environmental sample to distinguish actively growing
    organisms
  - substrate is enriched with a heavy isotopes to be consumed by the organisms to
    be studied
  - relies on the consuption of a substrate that is highly enriched by an isotope,
    such as <sup>13</sup>C
  - isotope-labeled carbon (<sup>13</sup>C) or nitrogen (<sup>15</sup>N) sources are
    assimilated into microbial environmental samples
  RNA stable isotope probing (RNA-SIP):
  - adding heavy isotopes into SSU ribosomal RNA to distinguish metabolically active
    organisms
  - active labeled substrate metabolism and incorporation of heavier mass isotopes
    into the RNA
  - environmental sample of 16S rRNA from bacteria is labeled with a carbon isotope
    (<sup>13</sup>C)
  suppressive subtraction hybridization (SSH):
  - compares microorganisms present in two different samples by removing identical
    DNA
  - takes advantage of the genetic differences between samples from two different
    areas
  - identical mRNA is removed from two different samples leaving only mRNA that is
    different
  BrdU:
  - halogenated nucleotides that can be incorporated into newly synthesized DNA and
    isolated
  - a labeled nucleotide is incorporated into the DNA of actively growing bacteria
    or viruses
  - bacteria that are actively growing will take up a nucleotide analog and incorporate
    it into its DNA
