matching pairs:
  (SEC): &id001
  - size separation in a column filled with porous beads
  - separates molecules by differences in size as they pass through a porous particles
    in a column
  - only liquid chromatography method where molecules do not bind to the chromatography
    particles
  - ability to separate protein samples by size using porous particles
  (GFC): *id001
  (IEX):
  - separate by charge, particle binding is controlled by pH of the solvent mobile
    phase
  - separates proteins with differences in surface charge
  - charged proteins interact with an oppositely charged chromatography particle resin
  - above its isoelectric point (pI), a protein will bind to a positively charged
    anion exchanger
  - below its isoelectric point (pI), a protein will bind to a negatively charged
    cation exchanger
  - separation method essentially based on the net charge of the protein
  - relies on charge-charge interactions between the proteins in your sample and the
    charges on the particle resin
  (HIC): &id002
  - separates by surface hydrophobicity, particle binding is controlled by salt concentration
    and/or organic solvents
  - separates proteins according to differences in their surface hydrophobicity
  - hydrophobic-based separations for protein characterization
  - for one type, high salt concentration enhances the interaction, whereas low salt
    concentrations weaken it
  - for one type, a decreasing salt gradient is used to separate samples in order
    of increasing hydrophobicity
  - technique based on the ability to separate proteins based on relative hydrophobic
    differences
  - for one type, gradients of increasing organic solvent concentration are used to
    affect separations
  (RPC): *id002
  (AC):
  - separation based on proteins binding to a ligand
  - separates proteins on the basis of a reversible interaction between the target
    protein and a specific ligand
  - works using resin-attached ligands to grab hold of the corresponding proteins
  - a specific ligand is attached to the particle resin in the column
  - relies on the specific and reversible binding of a protein to a matrix-bound ligand
  - ligand-attached beads bind directly to the protein of interest
