matching pairs:
  critval:
  - found in a table for a given degrees of freedom and losa
  - the boundary of how extreme a test statistic we need to support the nullhyp
  - the cutoff used to compare against the observed chi2 test statistic
  chi2 test statistic:
  - if this value is large, then there is stronger evidence to support the althyp
  - the bigger this number, the smaller the p-value
  - the sum of the normalized square difference between observed and expected data
  - a measure of the discrepancy between the observed and expected data sets
  losa:
  - the statistical cutoff of the result for the nullhyp to be supported or not
  - a constant probability that provides a cutoff for falsification of the nullhyp
  - the fixed probability for whether or not the nullhyp can be supported
  - a fixed probability cutoff whether the nullhyp can be or cannot be supported
  - standard cutoff probability used to determine statistic significance
  - biologists use a probability of 0.05 (5%) for this value
  p-value:
  - the probability of getting a result that is either the same or more extreme than
    the actual observations
  - if this value is small, then there is stronger evidence to support the althyp
  - the smaller this number, the bigger the chi2 test statistic
  - a small value suggests the observed data are not consistent with the nullhyp
  nullhyp:
  - we attempt to find evidence against this hypothesis in our chi2 test
  - we want to f2supp this hypothesis in our chi2 test
  - this hypothesis makes it easier to calculate the expected values
  althyp:
  - we are attempting to support this hypothesis indirectly by using the chi2 test
  - if the nullhyp cannot be supported , then this opposing hypothesis is supported
  - this hypothesis represents a deviation or bias from the expected pattern
  - for this hypothesis, the expected values are often impossible to calculate
  - we aim to support this hypothesis in our chi2 test
  dof:
  - usually one less than the number of observed categories (rows in the table)
  - represents how many independent values can vary after constraints are applied
  - in most chi2 tests, it is the number of observed categories (rows in the table)
    minus one
  - this number determines which row of the chi2 critval table you should use
