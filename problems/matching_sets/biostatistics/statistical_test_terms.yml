matching pairs:
  critval:
  - found in a table for given degrees of freedom and losa
  - the boundary for how extreme a teststat must be to reject the nullhyp
  - the cutoff used to compare against the observed teststat
  teststat:
  - a function of the data computed to test the nullhyp
  - a function of the data designed to measure agreement or disagreement with the
    null hypothesis
  - if this value is large in the direction favoring the althyp, there is stronger
    evidence against the nullhyp
  - the more extreme this value is under the nullhyp, the smaller the p-value
  losa:
  - the probability cutoff used to decide whether to reject the nullhyp
  - the probability cutoff that limits how often we mistakenly reject a true nullhyp
    (later called a Type I error).
  - the cutoff for how small a p-value must be to reject the nullhyp
  - standard cutoff probability used to determine statistical significance
  - biologists often use a probability of 0.05 (5%) for this value
  p-value:
  - the probability, under the nullhyp, of obtaining a result at least as extreme
    as the one observed
  - if this value is small, there is stronger evidence in favor of the althyp
  - if this value is small, it suggests that the observed data are not consistent
    with the nullhyp
  - smaller values typically correspond to more extreme teststat values
  nullhyp:
  - the hypothesis we attempt to find evidence against in a stattest
  - the hypothesis we want to reject in a stattest
  - this hypothesis defines the distribution used for comparison in the test
  - defines the distribution used for comparison in the test
  - defines the reference distribution used for comparison
  althyp:
  - the hypothesis we aim to support indirectly by rejecting another hypothesis
  - this hypothesis can sometimes be true even when the test fails to detect it (later
    called a Type II error)
  - can be true even if the test fails to detect it (later called a Type II error)
  - this hypothesis represents the possibility that the observed effect is real and
    not random
  - this hypothesis represents the possibility that the observed effect is not due
    to random chance
  - represents the possibility that an observed effect or relationship is real and
    not random
  - represents the possibility that an observed effect or relationship is not due
    to random chance
  dof:
  - a parameter based on sample size and estimated parameters or constraints
  - a parameter determined by sample size and the number of parameters
  - based on how many independent pieces of information are available
  - the count of values free to vary once constraints are applied
  - depends on sample size and restrictions from estimated parameters
