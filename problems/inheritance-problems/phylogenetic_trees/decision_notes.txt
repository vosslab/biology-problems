Journal direction

You leaned toward a classic journal article format, specifically JMBE Tips and Tools, because it reads like a normal CV line and lets you use figures and tables heavily.
You also kept JOSE in play as the shortest "software note" style option (Markdown in-repo, short paper), and you noted the Bioinformatics "Application Note" as another short format if you broaden the utility story.

Core focus of the paper

We agreed the novelty is not "counting phylogenetic trees," but the practical method and teaching utility:
* A compact tree-code encoding for rooted binary trees.
* A reproducible generation pipeline that produces exam items with answer keys by construction and tunable distractor similarity.
* The algorithmic pipeline framing: base shapes  internal-node flips  taxon relabeling  canonical filter  dedupe.

Best drafting format and workflow

For JMBE practicality, we converged on:
* Draft in LibreOffice ODT, then export an RTF "LLM copy" when you want iterative edits with an LLM.
* Keep figures separate while drafting, using placeholders and putting legends at the end.
* Final journal reality: export figures to TIFF/EPS when needed.

General section outline we planned

For JMBE Tips and Tools:
* Introduction (why subtree rotation equivalence trips students)
* Procedure (instructor workflow, difficulty controls, reproducibility)
* Conclusion (what instructors get, scope limits)
* Acknowledgments, References
* Tables + Figure legends at end, plus Additional files listing sample HTML, key, quick-start, and a short technical note.

Key technical points you did not want to lose
* The actual generation pipeline in treelib: inner-node flips via a bitmask, taxa relabeling, canonical filter, then set dedupe.
* Canonicalization is currently local and adjacent-character based, which is fast but has sharp edges with nested structure and multi-character taxa.
* Known fragility: multi-character labels wrapped as |NAME| can bypass the alpha checks, and there is at least one stale call to a missing function (replace_gene_letters) in an older path.
* A robust future-proof fix would be parse-and-canonicalize by subtree keys, then reserialize.

Teaching and accessibility note

We flagged that hidden text or micro-font watermarking in HTML can interfere with accessibility tooling, so the paper should recommend avoiding it or testing it with institutional accessibility support.

Naming discussion you were considering

You liked separating the "idea" name from the "software" name:
* PTA = Phylogenetic Tree Assessment (concept)
* PhyTAG = Phylogenetic Tree Assessment Generator (tool)
