#Which one of the following statements is FALSE/TRUE <connection word> <topic>
topic: PCR primers that are efficient and avoid mispriming

connection_words: ~

true_statements:
  truth1: The primers are about 18 to 30 nucleotides in length
  truth2: The primers are complementary to highly conserved regions of the genome
  truth3: Both primers have about the same melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>)
  truth5a: The primers' sequences do not bind to each other to form primer-dimers
  truth5b: The primers do not have complementary regions to each other
  truth6: The ends of their sequences do not bind to form secondary structures
  truth7: The percentage of G/C bases in the range of 40% to 60%
  truth8: The primers have a melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>) in the range of 50&deg;C to 65&deg;C
  truth9: The primers would ideally have unique sequences that a deficient in 1 of the 4 nucleotides

false_statements:
  false1a: The primers are shorter than 10 nucleotides in length
  false1b: The primers areat least 50 nucleotides in length, if not longer
  false2: The primers are complementary to highly variable regions of the genome
  false3: Each primer has a unique melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>), one is high and one is low
  false4: The primers are rich in A/T bases at the 3&prime; end to ensure good binding
  false5a: The primers are mostly complementary to each other
  false5b: The primers can readily bind to form primer-dimers
  false6: The ends of each primer are self-complementary to form strong secondary structure
  false7a: The percentage of G/C bases are less than 30%
  false7b: The percentage of G/C bases are more than 70%
  false8a: The primers have a melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>) less than 42&deg;C
  false8b: The primers have a melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>) more than 68&deg;C
  false9: Both primers must always contain all four possible nucleotides
