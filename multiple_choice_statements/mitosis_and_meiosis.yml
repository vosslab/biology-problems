true_statements:
  truth1a: Each daughter cell formed by mitosis has the same kinds of chromosomes as the parent cell
  truth1b: Each daughter cell formed by meiosis has the half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell

  truth2a: In mitosis, the parent cell and the daughter cells are genetically identical
  truth2b: The daughter cells produced at the end of meiosis are quite different from the original parent cell
  truth2c: Meiosis daughter cells contain half of the genetic material which is a mix of both the maternal and paternal genes

  truth3a: Mitosis is cell division that produces two (2) daughter cells
  truth3b: Meiosis is cell division that produces four (4) daughter cells

  truth4a: The cells resulting from meiosis cell division are haploid
  truth4b: The cells resulting from mitosis cell division are diploid

  truth5: Both meiosis and mitosis both start with only one cell

  truth6a: Mitosis produces new cells to help organisms grow in size and repair damaged tissue
  truth6b: Meiosis produces new gamete cells, such as sperm and egg

  truth7a: Mitosis goes through cytokinesis cell division once
  truth7b: Meiosis goes through cytokinesis cell division twice

  truth8a: Cross-over happens in meiosis, but not in mitosis
  truth8b: Mitosis does not involve crossing over of the chromosomes

  truth9a: Mitosis normally occurs in somatic cells of organisms and facilitates growth and development of organisms
  truth9b: Meiosis occurs in the gamete cells and facilitates sexual reproduction in living organisms

  truth10: Meiosis occurs in two phases, that is, meiosis I and meiosis II

  truth11: During the process of meiosis several processes occurs that cause genetic variation among organisms

  truth12: Meiosis I is the only stage where homologous chromosomes pair up and exchange genetic material

  truth13a: Only sexually reproductive organisms utilize meiosis
  truth13b: Meiosis is a special type of cell division that produces sex cells for reproduction
  truth13c: Both sexual and asexual organisms go through the process of mitosis
