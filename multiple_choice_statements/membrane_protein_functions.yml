true_statements:
  truth1a: They facilitate transport of molecules across the membrane
  truth1b: They allow passage of hydrophilic substances across the membrane
  truth1c: They provide a hydrophilic channel for certain molecules or ions to use as a tunnel
  truth1d: Some membrane proteins serve as channels, pumps, or receptors

  truth2a: They recognize and bind to other cells or substances
  truth2b: Carbohydrates covantly attached to membrane proteins allow cells to recognize eachother

  truth3a: They tightly attach the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix (ECM)
  truth3b: Some membrane proteins anchor the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane
  truth3c: Some membrane proteins anchor the extracellular matrix (ECM) to the plasma membrane

  truth4a: They provide enzymatic activity for certain chemical reactions
  truth4b: Some membrane proteins are enzymes that catalyze specific reactions

  truth5a: They receive cell signals and transduce them across the membrane
  truth5b: Some membrane proteins binds to signaling molecules such as hormones or neurotransmitters

  truth6a: They create intercellular junctions between adjacent cells
  truth6b: Some membrane proteins are repsonsible for attaching cells together

false_statements:
  false1a: They prevent the passage of hydrophobic substances across the membrane
  false1b: They block the passage of hydrophobic molecules from crossing the membrane

  false2a: They are responsible for separating the interior of the cell from its external environment
