true_statements:
  truth1a: The reaction rate is proportional to the substrate concentration.

  truth2a: M-M kinetics assumes the enzyme has a single active site.
  truth2b: M-M kinetics does not apply to allosteric enzymes.

  truth3a: M-M kinetics was developed by German biochemist Leonor Michaelis and Canadian physician Maud Menten in 1913.

  truth4a: M-M kinetics assumes a quasi-steady state, that the enzyme-substrate complex [ES] is constant.
  truth4b: M-M kinetics assumes that the change in concentration of enzyme-substrate complex [ES] does not change.
  truth4c: M-M kinetics assumes that the concentration of enzyme-substrate complex [ES] is constant.
  truth4d: M-M kinetics assumes that the rate of breaking the enzyme-substrate complex [ES] is equal to the rate of its formation.

  truth5a: M-M kinetics assumes that the enzyme bound to the product [EP] is short lived and does not contribute to the reaction rate.
  truth5b: M-M kinetics assumes that the enzyme-product complex [EP] is short lived and does not contribute to the reaction rate.

  truth6a: M-M kinetics assumes that there is no product available and there is no measureable reverse reaction rate.
  truth6b: M-M kinetics assumes that the product is not available and there is no measureable reverse reaction rate.
