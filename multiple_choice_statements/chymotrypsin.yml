true_statements:
  truth1a: Chymotrypsin prefers to cleave after large aromatic amino acids.

  truth2a: The shape of the S1 pocket of Chymotrypsin helps determine which residues are cut.
  truth2b: The amino acid tyrosine fits well into the S1 pocket of Chymotrypsin.
  truth2c: The amino acid phenylalanine fits well into the S1 pocket of Chymotrypsin.
  truth2d: The amino acid tryptophan fits well into the S1 pocket of Chymotrypsin.

  truth3a: The S1 pocket of Chymotrypsin is designed to bind hydrophobic side chains.
  truth3b: The S1 pocket of Chymotrypsin is deep and hydrophobic.
  truth3c: The substrate specificity of Chymotrypsin is mostly due to the properties of its S1 pocket.

  truth4a: Chymotrypsin helps break down dietary proteins into smaller peptides.
  truth4b: Chymotrypsin is used to digest proteins in the small intestine.

  truth5a: Chymotrypsin sometimes cleaves after hydrophobic amino acids, leucine and methionine.

  truth6a: Chymotrypsin works in two main phases, cutting and resetting.
  truth6b: The free Chymotrypsin enzyme is regenerated using water in the second phase of the reaction.

  truth21a: Chymotrypsin contains a cleft where peptide bonds are broken.

false_statements:

  false1b: Chymotrypsin cleaves randomly along the protein backbone.
  false1c: Chymotrypsin prefers to cleave after negatively charged amino acids.
  false1d: Chymotrypsin prefers to cleave after small, polar amino acids.
  false1e: Chymotrypsin cleaves only at the N-terminus of peptides.

  false3a: The S1 pocket of Chymotrypsin is shallow and positively charged.
  false3b: The S1 pocket of Chymotrypsin is shallow and negatively charged.
  false3c: The S1 pocket of Chymotrypsin is deep and positively charged.
  false3d: The S1 pocket of Chymotrypsin is deep and negatively charged.
  false3e: The S1 pocket of Chymotrypsin prefers charged polar side chains.

  false4a: Chymotrypsin only acts on carbohydrate side chains.
  false4b: Chymotrypsin only acts on triglyceride fatty acid side chains.
  false4c: Chymotrypsin works to break down polysaccharides.
  false4d: Chymotrypsin assembles peptide chains from free amino acids.
  false4e: Chymotrypsin digests carbohydrates in the stomach.
  false4f: Chymotrypsin digests fats and oils in the stomach.
  false4g: Chymotrypsin is primarily used to digest nucleic acids.
  false4h: Chymotrypsin is active in the acidic environment of the stomach.

  false5a: Chymotrypsin sometimes cleaves after small amino acids, glycine and alanine.
  false5b: Chymotrypsin sometimes cleaves after polar amino acids, serine and threonine.
  false5c: Chymotrypsin sometimes cleaves after the negatively charged amino acid, glutamine.
  false5d: Chymotrypsin sometimes cleaves after the positively charged amino acid, lysine.

  false6a: Chymotrypsin cuts proteins all at once, without forming intermediates.

  false11a: Water has no role in the enzyme function of Chymotrypsin.
  false11b: Chymotrypsin does not require water at any point in its mechanism.

  false12a: Chymotrypsin requires ATP to cleave peptide bonds.

  false13a: The S1 pocket of Chymotrypsin binds metal ions to stabilize the substrate.
