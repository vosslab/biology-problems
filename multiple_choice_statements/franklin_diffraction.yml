topic: ~
override_question_true: ~
override_question_false: What information was NOT obtained from Rosalind Franklin's diffraction pattern in Photograph 51?
connection_words: ~

true_statements:
  truth1: distance between nucleotides along DNA double helix
  truth2: diameter of the DNA double helix
  truth3: distance between turns of the DNA double helix (pitch)
  truth4a: DNA exists as an anti-parallel double helix
  truth4b: DNA contains two strands, with each strand running in opposite directions
  truth5: the angle of the pitch in the DNA double helix
  truth6: the DNA bases face the inside of the helix
  truth7: the phosphate groups are on the outside of the DNA double helix
  turth8: the DNA double helix had ten nucleotides between each turn

false_statements:
  false1: A-T and G-C base pairing system
  false2a: amount of adenine is equal to that of thymine
  false2b: amount of guanine is equal to that of cytosine
  #Jerry O'Donohue
  false3a: identification of the correct tautomers or protonation state of nucleobases
  false3b: identification of the correct (keto rather than enol) tautomeric forms for the nucleobases
  false4: DNA is the genetic material responsible for inheritance
  false5: G-C base pairs have three hydrogen bonds, whereas A-T base pairs only have two hydrogen bonds
  false6: G-C base pairs are stronger than A-T base pairs


# conflicts, means that the statements cannot appear together
# add ': True' to each line, so the program runs a faster lookup
