true_statements:
  truth11: distance between nucleotides along DNA double helix
  truth12: diameter of the DNA double helix
  truth13: distance between turns of the DNA double helix (pitch)

  truth14a: DNA exists as an anti-parallel double helix

  truth15: the angle of the pitch in the DNA double helix
  truth16: the DNA bases face the inside of the helix
  truth17: the phosphate groups are on the outside of the DNA double helix
  turth18: the DNA double helix had ten nucleotides between each turn

false_statements:
  false1: A-T and G-C base pairing system

  false2a: amount of guanine is equal to that of thymine
  false2b: amount of adenine is equal to that of cytosine
  false2c: amount of thymine is equal to that of guanine

  #Jerry O'Donohue
  false3a: identification of the correct tautomers or protonation state of the nucleobases
  false3b: identification of the correct (keto rather than enol) tautomeric forms for the nucleobases

  false4: DNA is the genetic material responsible for inheritance

  false5q: G-C base pairs have three hydrogen bonds, whereas A-T base pairs only have two hydrogen bonds
  false5b: G-C base pairs are stronger than A-T base pairs
  false5c: A-T base pairs are weaker than G-C base pairs
