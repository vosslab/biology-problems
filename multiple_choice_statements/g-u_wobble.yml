topic: the G&cdot;U wobble base pair

connection_words: ~

true_statements:
  truth11: the G&cdot;U wobble base pair ribose sugar glycosidic bond angles are shifted from normal

  truth12: the G&cdot;U wobble base pair is a fundamental unit of RNA secondary structure

  truth13: the G&cdot;U wobble base pair differs in the orientation of the bases with respect to the backbone

  truth14: the G&cdot;U wobble base pair the most common mismatch (non Watson-Crick) in the RNA helices

  truth15: the G&cdot;U wobble base pair provides unique hydrogen bond donors and acceptors in the major and minor grooves of the RNA helices

  truth16: unlike Watson-Crick base pairs, the G&cdot;U wobble base pair does not have a amino group in the minor groove

false_statements:
  false1: the G&cdot;U wobble base pair causes the local double helix region to wobble in solution
