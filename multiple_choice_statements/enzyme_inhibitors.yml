true_statements:
  truth01a: Competitive$inhibitors bind to the active site of an enzyme and compete with the substrate for binding.
  truth01b: Competitive$inhibitors bind to the active site of an enzyme.
  truth01c: Competitive$inhibitors compete with the substrate for active site binding.
  truth01d: Competitive$inhibitors have a structure that is similar to the substrate.
  truth01e: Competitive$inhibitors can be overcome by increasing the concentration of the substrate.

  truth02a: Noncompetitive$inhibitors do not bind the active site, but can alter active site conformation.
  truth02b: Noncompetitive$inhibitors do not bind the active site, but can reduce active site activity.
  truth02c: Noncompetitive$inhibitors bind to a site on the enzyme that is distinct from the active site
  truth02d: Noncompetitive$inhibitors do not affect substrate binding, but they do decrease catalysis.

  truth03a: Uncompetitive$inhibitors bind to the enzyme-substrate complex and prevent product formation.
  truth03b: Uncompetitive$inhibitors only bind to the enzyme-substrate complex.
  truth03d: Uncompetitive$inhibitors have a higher affinity for the enzyme-substrate complex than for the free enzyme.
