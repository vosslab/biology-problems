matching pairs:
  Leptotene:
    - chromosomes begin to condense
    - thread-like chromomeres become visible along the chromosomes
    - chromosomes first become visible as thin thread-like structures
    - chromosomes first appear as fine discrete threads
    - chromomeres appear as bead-like thickenings along the chromosomes
    - condensation begins and chromosomes become visible as thin threads

  Zygotene:
    - synapsis begins
    - the pairing of homologous chromosomes begins
    - the synapsis process forms numerous points of contact between homologs
    - stage where homologous chromosomes become paired
    - homologous chromosomes align and pair
    - synapsis of homologous chromosomes occurs
    - strands of homologous chromosomes line up and become pairs

  Pachytene, early or late:
    - synapsis is complete
    - the pairing of homologous chromosomes is complete
    - crossing over occurs between non-sister chromatids
    - crossing over occurs between homologous chromosomes
    - exchange of segments between non-sister chromatids may occur
    - exchange of segments between homologous chromosomes may occur
    - chromosomes continue to shorten and thicken

  Diplotene or Diakinesis, combined:
    - the paired chromosomes begin to separate
    - chiasmata are visible between homologous chromosomes
    - homologous chromosomes begin to migrate apart
    - homologous chromosome pairs begin to separate and chiasmata become visible
    - homologous chromosomes separate and chiasmata become visible
    - homologous chromosomes are held together only by the chiasmata
    - chromosomes become further condensed
    - chromosomes reach near-maximal condensation in late prophase I
    - nucleolus and nuclear envelope disappear while spindle fibers form
