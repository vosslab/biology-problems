matching pairs:
  Leptotene:
    - chromosomes start to condense
    - thread-like chromomeres first become visible
    - chromosomes first become visible in the form of thread-like structures
    - chromosomes first appear as fine discrete threads
    - chromosomes start forming thin thread-like structures
    - condensation of the chromosomes wherein they first become visible as chromatin
    - uncoiling and condensing of chromosomes first takes place

  Zygotene:
    - synapsis begins
    - the pairing of homologous chromosomes begins
    - the synapsis process forms numerous points of contact
    - stage where homologous chromosomes become paired
    - homologous chromosomes come together and pair
    - synapsis of homologous chromosomes occurs
    - strands of homologous chromosomes line up and become pairs

  Early/Late Pachytene:
    - synapsis is complete
    - the pairing of homologous chromosomes is complete
    - crossing-over occurs at the chiasmata
    - crossing-over occurs between homologous chromosomes
    - the swapping of genetic material occurs between homologous chromosomes
    - the swapping of genetic material occurs at the chiasmata
    - exchange of segments between chromatids may occur
    - chromosomes continue to shorten and thicken
    - sister chromatids first become visible

  Diplotene and/or Diakinesis:
    - the paired chromosomes being to separate
    - every chiasmata is fully visible at this stage
    - homologous chromosomes begin to migrate apart
    - homologous chromosome pairs begin to separate and chiasmata become visible
    - the paired homologous chromosomes begin to separate
    - homologous chromosomes separate and chiasmata become visible
    - homologous chromosomes are held together only by the chiasmata
    - chromosomes are at their most condensed form
    - homologous chromosomes reach maximum repulsion before separation
    - characterized by shortening and thickening of the paired chromosomes
    - the chromosomes shorten in preparation for anaphase
    - both the nucleolus and nuclear envelope disappear while spindle fibers form
