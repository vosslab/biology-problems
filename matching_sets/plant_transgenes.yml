matching pairs:
  DREB1A:
    - Enhances the plant's ability to retain water under drought conditions
    - Activates stress-responsive genes to help cope with arid environments
    - Primarily found in plants that are modified to thrive in drought-prone areas
    - Known for its role in enhancing abiotic stress tolerance, particularly drought
    - Increases the osmotic potential in plants, allowing them to survive longer without water

  Cry/Bt:
    - Functions by producing a protein toxic to specific insect larvae
    - Commonly utilized in crops like corn and cotton to reduce reliance on chemical pesticides
    - Is derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis
    - Binds to receptors in the insect gut, leading to cell lysis and death
    - Considered an environmentally friendly method for pest control as it reduces chemical pesticide use
    - Often integrated into plant genomes to produce Cry proteins throughout the plant's lifecycle

  AVP1:
    - Encodes a proton pump that helps plants tolerate salty environments
    - Increases root growth and biomass in transgenic plants
    - Plays a key role in vacuolar proton transport
    - Often engineered into plants that require high salt tolerance
    - Enhances water-use efficiency by increasing cellular ion retention
    - Associated with improved phosphorus uptake in plants

    aro A (Glyphosate Resistant)

Allows for resistance to glyphosate herbicides
Developed by transferring aro A gene into a glyphosate EPSP synthetase from Salmonella typhimurium and E. coli
Mutant ALS (Sulphonylurea Resistant)

Encodes for a mutant acetolactate synthetase that allows for resistance to Sulphonylurea herbicides
Originates from Arabidopsis
QB Protein (Atrazine Resistant)

Derived from mutant Amaranthus hybrids
Produces atrazine-resistant transgenic plants
TMV Coat Proteins (Virus Resistant)

Provides resistance against Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV)
Developed by introducing viral coat proteins
Beta-Carotene Genes (Nutritional Benefits)

Increases production of beta-carotene as a precursor to vitamin A
Derived from daffodils and microorganisms
Salt Tolerance Gene (from Mangroves)

Provides salt tolerance
Derived from Avicennia marina
gut D Gene (Salt Tolerance)

Used to generate salt-tolerant transgenic maize plants
Originates from Escherichia coli
Therapeutic Proteins

Produces antibodies, proteins, or vaccines for therapeutic use
Could be useful for various diseases ranging from dental caries to certain cancers
Enhanced Shelf Life Genes

Provides enhanced ability to withstand long-distance transportation
Allows for longer shelf life of produce
