matching pairs:
  Glycolysis:
    - First stage of cellular respiration
    - For each molecule of glucose, this stage produces two (2) ATP and two (2) NADH molecules
    - The only stage of cellular respiration that takes place in the cytosol of the cell

  Pyruvate&nbsp;Oxidation:
    - Short stage that produces carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and NADH
    - Takes pyruvate as input and produces acetyl-CoA
    - A stage that links glycolysis to the rest of cellular respiration
    - Pyruvate must enter the mitochondrial matrix for this stage to begin
    - This stage is entirely carried out by a large enzyme complex called the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex
    - For each molecule of glucose, this stage produces zero (0) ATP and two (2) NADH molecules
    - First stage of cellular respiration that occurs within the mitochondria organelles

  Cirtic Acid Cycle (TCA cycle):
    - Starts by joining a four carbon sugar and a two carbon sugar
    - Forms a GTP molecule which is equivalent to an ATP molecule
    - Final stage in the oxidation of glucose into carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)
    - Acetyl CoA serves as fuel for this stage of cellular respiration
    - This stage was identified by Hans Krebs and William Johnson in 1937 and is sometimes called the "Krebs cycle"
    - Begins with the transfer of a two-carbon acetyl group to a four-carbon acceptor to form a six-carbon compound
    - Begins with the transfer of a two-carbon acetyl CoA to a four-carbon oxaloacetate to form a six-carbon citrate
    - The only stage of cellular respiration that produces the electron acceptor FADH<sub>2</sub>
    - At the end this stage, the four-carbon oxaloacetate has been regenerated, and the stage repeats.
    - For each molecule of glucose, this stage produces two (2) ATP, six (6) NADH, and two (2) FADH<sub>2</sub> molecules

  Electron Transport Chain (ETC):
    - Stage of cellular respiration that extracts energy from the electron carriers NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub>
    - Occurs in the membrane of the mitochondrial matrix to produce the electrochemical gradient
    - Involves a series of protein complexes to extract redox energy from the high energy electrons

  Chemiosmosis:
    - Stage of cellular respiration that produces the most ATP
    - Occurs in the membrane of the mitochondrial matrix to produce ATP
    - Uses the electrochemical gradient to produce substrate-level phosphorylation energy molecules
    - The protein ATP synthase works like a water turbine in a dam
    - The only stage of cellular respiration that does NOT involve electron carriers
