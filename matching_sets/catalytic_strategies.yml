matching pairs:

    Acid-base Catalysis:
    - A side chain removes a hydrogen to enhance electron density for attack.
    - A hydrogen is transferred to or from a reactive group to make it more reactive.
    - A group adjusts the electron flow by altering local charge through hydrogen transfer.
    - A hydrogen shift increases the effectiveness of a nearby atom in bond formation or cleavage.
    - A functional group removes a proton to activate a nearby nucleophilic residue.
    - Transfer of a proton improves the departure of an unstable leaving group.
    - Movement of a hydrogen atom influences the readiness of atoms to make or break bonds.
    - Has reactions involving electron pairs, commonly involving a proton exchange.

    Active Site Microenvironment:
    - Local polarity and charge are tuned to create favorable reaction conditions.
    - Electrostatic forces within the active site are adjusted to promote the reaction.
    - Charge distributions are optimized in the catalytic pocket to support intermediate stability.
    - Chemical surroundings are adapted to promote bond changes during the reaction.
    - The spatial arrangement of atoms influences ionization and electron flow.
    - The immediate setting of the reactive site alters how atoms interact during catalysis.

    ATP Hydrolysis:
    - A high energy molecule is broken down to drive conformational shifts.
    - Breakdown of a high-energy compound powers chemical transitions.
    - Cleaving a specific high-energy bond allows the system to overcome energetic barriers.
    - A secondary high-energy process brings energy into the system to promote transformation.
    - High-energy bond cleavage is coupled to chemical changes in the system.

    Bond Strain or Distortion:
    - The substrate is bent or twisted into a higher-energy conformation.
    - Structural tension is introduced into the substrate to increase the likelihood of reaction.
    - The substrate is reshaped into a geometry more favorable for reaction.
    - Mechanical stress is applied to stretch or compress bonds in the substrate.
    - The molecular arrangement of the substrate is structurally destabilized.
    - The substrate is forced into a conformation resembling the transition state.

    Catalysis by Approximation:
    - Multiple substrates are brought together and precisely positioned for interaction.
    - Reacting groups of the substrate are aligned in close space to favor bond formation.
    - Substrates are oriented in a geometry that enhances the chance of chemical change.
    - The reaction site arranges substrate components to ensure correct position for reaction.
    - Local concentration of substrates is effectively increased by spatial confinement.
    - When two substrates are brought into close proximity with one another.

    Covalent Catalysis:
    - A temporary link is formed between the substrate and the enzyme.
    - A direct interaction creates an intermediate enzyme-substrate complex that alters the reaction pathway.
    - The enzyme briefly attaches to the substrate during the reaction.
    - A short-lived connection forms between the substrate and the enzyme.
    - A reactive group on the enzyme bonds to the substrate to initiate a new pathway.
    - The substrate and enzyme form an intermediate complex before completing the reaction.
    - The enzyme forms a bond with the substrate that facilitates conversion into the product.
    - The reaction proceeds through a stage where the substrate is attached to the enzyme.
    - Creates a new reaction pathway, i.e., adds an additional step in the reaction

    Metal Ion and Electrostatic Catalysis:
    - A positively charged ion attracts or repels electrons to promote the reaction.
    - The arrangement of charged ions help guide the substrate into the ideal position for chemistry.
    - A charged ion stabilizes areas with too many electrons during a reaction step.
    - Reactive partners are activated through interactions with nearby charged groups.
    - The reaction center is stabilized by charge-based interactions during the transition state.
    - A charged ion holds the substrate in the right position for the reaction.
    - An ion in the active site interacts with the substrate to support the reaction.
    - A charged ion helps stabilize unstable intermediates during the reaction.
    - Ions help organize the charges of important groups in the reaction.
    - Uses a special cation to stabilize a negative charge in the active site
    - uses an ion that can also act to stabilize the charges on the intermediates in the reaction.
