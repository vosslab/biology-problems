matching pairs:

   Acid-base catalysis:
   - Proton transfer involving amino acid side chains that donate or accept protons.
   - A catalytic mechanism where enzyme residues act as acids or bases to facilitate the reaction.
   - Involves side chains stabilizing intermediates through donation or removal of protons.
   - Uses functional groups in the active site to act as general acids or bases in a chemical step.
   - A strategy where non-water proton donors or acceptors accelerate reaction steps.

   Active Site Microenvironment:
   - Local changes in pH, charge, or polarity in the active site to favor reactivity.
   - The chemical surroundings of the active site are tuned to stabilize charged intermediates.
   - The active site adjusts conditions like polarity or electrostatics to facilitate catalysis.
   - Active site residues and cofactors create a specialized environment for optimal reactivity.
   - Reaction rates are enhanced by localized chemical environments favoring the transition state.

   ATP Hydrolysis:
   - Provides energy for conformational changes or coupling to drive endergonic steps.
   - Supplies energy to power mechanical or chemical transitions in enzyme function.
   - Often drives reactions forward by coupling an unfavorable step with ATP breakdown.
   - Used to activate enzymes or substrates by phosphoryl transfer or energy input.
   - ATP cleavage provides thermodynamic driving force for energetically costly reactions.

   Bond Strain or Distortion:
   - Enzyme stresses the substrate toward its transition-state conformation.
   - Stresses the substrate to make substrate geometry resemble the transition state.
   - Binding causes substrate deformation that lowers the energy required for bond breaking.
   - Active site interactions pull on bonds to destabilize its structure.
   - Reaction barriers are lowered by forcing substrates into strained configurations.

   Catalysis by Approximation:
   - Brings two or more substrates close together in optimal orientation for reaction.
   - Enhances catalysis by aligning reactive groups of bound substrates.
   - Substrate binding increases local concentration and proper spatial orientation.
   - Reactive molecules are positioned next to each other to facilitate interaction.
   - The enzyme acts as a scaffold that brings multiple reactants into proximity.

   Covalent Catalysis:
   - Formation of a transient covalent bond between enzyme and substrate.
   - Involves nucleophilic attack by an active site residue forming a covalent intermediate.
   - A catalytic strategy using a temporary covalent linkage to stabilize the transition state.
   - Reaction proceeds through a new pathway involving enzyme-substrate covalent interaction.
   - An enzyme residue forms a reactive intermediate via bond formation with the substrate.

   Metal Ion Catalysis:
   - Stabilization of negative charges or participation in redox via metal cofactors.
   - Metal ions aid catalysis by coordinating substrates or stabilizing charge build-up.
   - Catalysis involving electron transfer or electrostatic shielding by metal ions.
   - Metal cofactors orient substrates or promote reactions through charge interactions.
   - A mechanism where metal ions serve as Lewis acids or redox agents during catalysis.
