    - a cell or organism that a single set of chromosomes

  diploid:
    - a cell or organism that has paired chromosomes

  gene:
    - the unit of inheritance passed from parents to offspring
    - the main elements of heredity

  genetics:
    - the study of heredity and the variation of inherited characteristics
    - the study of the effect of genetic differences on organisms
    - study of genes, genetic variation, and heredity in organisms
    - scientific study of how genes control the characteristics of plants and animals
    - study of both trait and molecular inheritance mechanisms of genes
    - the study of heredity and how genes control the inherited characteristics

  genetic code:
    - the set of instructions that tell a cell how to make a specific protein
    - the set of rules used by living cells to translate information encoded within genetic material into proteins
    - the set of instructions that converts the sequence of nucleotides into an amino acid sequence in proteins
    - the code our body uses to convert the instructions contained in our DNA the essential materials of life

  genomics:
    - the study of all of the genes in an organism
    - the structure, function, evolution, and mapping of genomes

  genome:
    - an organism's complete set of DNA
    - complete set of DNA in an organism
    - complete set of DNA in a cell or organism

  locus:
    - location of a gene on a chromosome
    - where on a chromosome a specific gene is located
    - a specific, fixed position on a chromosome of a particular gene
    - a spot or "address" on a chromosome at which a gene for a particular trait is located
    - the physical position of a gene within a chromosome

  single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP):
    - variation resulting from a single base pair change
    - most common type of genetic variation among people
    - a genomic variant at a single base position in the DNA
    - a substitution of a single nucleotide at a specific position in the genome

  homologous chromosomes:
    - two similar but different copies of a chromosome
    - one chromosome from the mother and one chromosome from the father
    - two chromosomes which carry the same genes, one from each parental source
    - chromosomes which contain the same genes in the same order along their chromosomal arms
    - chromosomes of similar length, gene position, and centromere location
    - two chromosomes containing identical genetic loci although possibly different allelic forms
