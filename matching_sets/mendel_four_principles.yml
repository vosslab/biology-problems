matching pairs:
  Principle of Paired Factors:
    - each organism has two alleles that make up the genotype for a given trait
    - character is represented in an organism by at least two factors
    - in an organism, a two separate factors control the appearance of a given characteristic
    - for a given characteristic, each trait consists of two alleles
    - each organism has two alleles for each gene

  Principle of Dominance:
    - out of the two contrasting alleles for the same gene, only one is able to express its effect
    - for each character there is a dominant allele, the trait is determined by dominant allele
    - for each genotype there is a dominant allele, the phenotype is determined by dominant allele
    - hybrid offspring will only inherit the dominant allele as its phenotype
    - in hybrid offspring, their recessive alleles are suppressed and not present in its phenotype
    - in hybrid offspring, their dominant alleles are expressed and determine its phenotype
    - in an organism that is heterozygous for a geneotype only the dominant trait will be seen
    - some alleles are dominant, which means that their phenotype will mask the recessive phenotype

  Law of Segregation:
    - each parent contributes just one of their two alleles to its offspring
    - two factors of a character get randomly distributed to different gametes
    - when the gametes are formed, the factors separate and are distributed as units to each gamete
    - two copies of each factor segregate so that offspring acquire one factor from each parent
    - allele pairs separate during the formation of gametes and re-unite randomly during fertilization
    - two alleles for each trait separate during the formation of gametes and re-unite randomly during fertilization
    - only one random allele from each parent combines during fertilization
    - a gamete carries only a recessive or a dominant allele but not both the alleles
    - alleles separate and recombine randomly during meiosis and fertilization
    - pairs of characters separate during gamete formation

  Law of Independent Assortment:
    - two different characters will be inherited separately of each other
    - inheritance of genes at one location does not influence the inheritance of genes at another location
    - different pairs of alleles are passed onto the offspring independently of each other
    - two factors of each character separate independent of other characters at the time of gamete formation
    - a pair of traits segregates independently of another pair during gamete formation
