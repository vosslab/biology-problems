# Guidelines for Mendel's Foundational Principles of Genetics statements
# 1. Use 'alleles' or 'genes' instead of 'genetic elements'.
# 2. Use 'gamete' instead of 'reproductive cell' or 'sex cell'.
# 3. Avoid discussing parents or inheritance for the first two principles: Paired Factors and Dominance.
# 4. Avoid using tip-off keywords in the descriptions for the principles (e.g., pair, factors, segregate, independent, assortment). # 4a. Keywords may be used in the descriptions of other principles.
# 4b. Synonyms for keywords are acceptable, like "sorting" for "assortment," but avoid making a direct connection.
# 5. Use Mendelian specific genetics vocabulary: genes, factors, alleles, dominant, recessive, phenotype, genotype, character, trait.
# 6. Avoid complex non-genetics vocabulary (e.g., counterpart, constitute, manifest, contrasting, dictates, precedence).
# 7. Use accurate genetics vocabulary: differentiate between trait/character, dominant/recessive, genotype/phenotype.
# 8. Keep the focus on "Mendel's Foundational Principles of Genetics"; modern exceptions like co-dominance, epistasis, and linked genes should not be included.
# 9. Be clear and simple; the statements should be easily understood by those with a basic understanding of genetics.

matching pairs:
  Principle_of_Paired_Factors:
    - Each organism has two alleles that make up the genotype for a given trait.
    - Character is represented in an organism by two alleles.
    - For a given characteristic, each trait consists of two alleles.
    - Each organism has two alleles for each gene.
    - Genotypes for specific traits are determined by two alleles.
    - Two alleles contribute to an organism's characteristic.
    - An organism possesses two alleles for each specific trait.
    - The genetic makeup for a particular characteristic in an organism involves two alleles.
    - A single trait in an organism is influenced by two alleles.
    - The presence of two alleles accounts for each trait in an organism.
    - An organism has two alleles that make up the genotype for a specific trait.
    - Each trait in an organism is determined by two alleles.
    - Two alleles define each specific trait in an organism.
    - Two alleles determine a single trait in the offspring.
    - Each organism has two alleles that influence a given characteristic.
    - For every characteristic, an organism possesses two alleles.
    - The genetic makeup for each character involves two alleles.

  Principle_of_Dominance:
    - Out of the two different alleles for the same gene, only one is able to express its effect.
    - For each character there is a dominant allele, the trait is determined by that allele.
    - For each genotype there is a dominant allele, the phenotype is determined by that allele.
    - Recessive alleles are not expressed in the phenotype of the hybrid organism.
    - Dominant alleles are the ones that determine the phenotype of the hybrid organism.
    - Some alleles are dominant, which means that their phenotype will mask the recessive phenotype.
    - Dominant alleles mask the expression of their recessive counterparts.
    - In cases where contrasting alleles are present, the dominant allele determines the phenotype.
    - Dominant alleles express their effects even when present in just a single copy.
    - If contrasting alleles are present, the dominant one determines the phenotype.
    - Presence of a dominant allele overrides the expression of the recessive allele.
    - When different alleles exist, the dominant alleles determines the organism's traits.
    - In a set of differing alleles, one will usually mask the effect of the other.
    - When two different alleles are present, one usually determines the observable traits.
    - One allele's traits will often be expressed over another allele's when both are present.
    - The observable traits with mixed alleles are usually determined by one dominant allele.
    - When different alleles are present, the effect of one will generally dominate.

  Law_of_Segregation:
    - Each parent contributes just one of their two alleles to its offspring.
    - Two factors of a character get randomly distributed to different gametes.
    - When the gametes are formed, the factors separate and are distributed as units to each gamete.
    - Allele pairs separate during the formation of gametes.
    - Two alleles for each trait separate during the formation of gametes.
    - A gamete carries only one allele for a gene but not both the alleles.
    - Pairs of alleles separate during gamete formation.
    - During gamete formation, allele pairs are separated into individual gametes.
    - Each parent passes a single allele for each trait to the offspring during sexual reproduction.
    - One allele from each gene pair is transmitted to an individual gamete.
    - During the creation of gametes, alleles are distributed individually.
    - Alleles from each parent are separated into individual gametes.
    - During the creation of gametes, each parent contributes a single allele for each characteristic.
    - A gamete carries just one of the two alleles for each characteristic.
    - Two alleles for a character are randomly distributed into different gametes.

  Law_of_Independent_Assortment:
    - Two different characters will be inherited separately from each other.
    - Inheritance of genes at one location does not influence the inheritance of genes at another location.
    - The segregation of one gene pair doesn't affect the segregation of another.
    - Inheritance patterns for one trait do not interfere with those of another trait.
    - The segregation of one pair of alleles is not influenced by another pair.
    - Traits from different genes are passed down separately from one another.
    - The inheritance of one gene has no bearing on the inheritance of another gene located at a different location.
    - Genes at one location have no impact on the inheritance of genes at a separate location.
    - The factors affecting one characteristic don't alter the factors affecting another characteristic during gamete creation.
    - Traits inherited from different genes do not influence each other.
    - Sorting one pair of alleles into gametes does not alter the sorting of another pair of alleles.
    - No connection exists between the inheritance patterns of one trait and those of a different trait.
    - During the creation of gametes, the grouping of one set of alleles doesn't affect the grouping of another set.
    - Each pair of traits is passed down without any impact on the passage of other pairs during the creation of gametes.
    - The inheritance of one gene does not impact the inheritance of another separate gene.
    - The inheritance of one trait doesn't influence the inheritance of another.
    - Alleles for different traits are passed down without influencing each other.
    - Traits from separate genes do not affect each other during the reproductive process.
    - In the process of forming gametes, each set of alleles sorts without impacting another set.
    - The inheritance of one set of alleles has no impact on another set.
