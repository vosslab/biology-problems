matching pairs:
  gpcrZZ:
    - the protein contains 7TM &alpha;-helices
    - often called 7TM receptors  based on their structure
    - the receptor acts as a GEF by exchanging GDP for GTP to activate a nearby protein
    - when this receptor binds the extracellular primary messenger, it then activates another intracellular protein
    - the time the message from this receptor is active is based on how long it takes to hydrolyze GTP to GDP
    - this receptor is responsible for our taste sensing of bitter, umami (savory), and sweet substances

  rtkZZ:
    - form a dimers upon binding of the extracellular primary messenger 
    - performs autophosphorylation, <i>i.e.</i>, it phosphorylates itself
    - contains several intracellular <i>Tyr</i> amino acids that are phosphorylated when activated
    - extracellular ligand binding will typically causes the receptor to form a dimer
    - the only receptor where the receptor becomes phosphorylated when activated
    - unlike other forms of this receptor, the insulin receptor (IR) still forms a dimer, but monomers are permanently held together via disulfide bonds

  lgicZZ:
    - when this receptor is activated, it can cause an immediate change in the electrochemical gradient
    - upon binding of the extracellular primary messenger, this receptor opens to allow ions to pass through the membrane
    - often in neurons when this receptor is activated, it can cause membrane depolarization leading to an action potential
    - when this receptor is activated, it can cause a rapid depolarization of membrane potential due to an influx of ions
