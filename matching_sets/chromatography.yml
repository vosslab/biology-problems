matching pairs:
  (SEC): &id01
    - size separation in a column filled with porous beads
    - separates molecules by differences in size as they pass through a porous particles in a column
    - only liquid chromatography method where molecules do not bind to the chromatography particles
    - ability to separate protein samples by size using porous particles

#duplicate of SEC
  (GFC): *id01

  (IEX):
    - separate by charge, particle binding is controlled by pH of the solvent mobile phase
    - separates proteins with differences in surface charge
    - charged proteins interact with an oppositely charged chromatography particle resin
    - above its isoelectric point (pI), a protein will bind to a positively charged anion exchanger
    - below its isoelectric point (pI), a protein will bind to a negatively charged cation exchanger
    - separation method essentially based on the net charge of the protein
    - relies on charge-charge interactions between the proteins in your sample and the charges on the particle resin

  (HIC): &id03
    - separates by surface hydrophobicity, particle binding is controlled by salt concentration and/or organic solvents
    - separates proteins according to differences in their surface hydrophobicity
    - hydrophobic-based separations for protein characterization
    - for one type, high salt concentration enhances the interaction, whereas low salt concentrations weaken it
    - for one type, a decreasing salt gradient is used to separate samples in order of increasing hydrophobicity
    - technique based on the ability to separate proteins based on relative hydrophobic differences
    - for one type, gradients of increasing organic solvent concentration are used to affect separations

#duplicate of HIC
  (RPC): *id03

  (AC):
    - separation based on proteins binding to a ligand
    - separates proteins on the basis of a reversible interaction between the target protein and a specific ligand
    - works using resin-attached ligands to grab hold of the corresponding proteins
    - a specific ligand is attached to the particle resin in the column
    - relies on the specific and reversible binding of a protein to a matrix-bound ligand
    - ligand-attached beads bind directly to the protein of interest

exclude pairs:
  - [(SEC), (GFC)]
  - [(HIC), (RPC)]
