matching pairs:
  DNA gyrase:
    - this enzyme relieves strain in the parental DNA double helix caused by the supercoiling
    - this enzyme releases the supercoiling tension in the DNA double helix
  primase:
    - this enzyme builds RNA primers using the parental DNA strand as a template
    - this enzyme creates the RNA primers that serve as a starting point for DNA synthesis
  DNA helicase:
    - this enzyme unwinds the parental DNA double helix
    - this enzyme separates the two strands of the DNA double helix
  DNA ligase:
    - this enzyme joins Okazaki fragments together to create one continuous DNA strand
    - this enzyme seals the gaps between the Okazaki fragments to create one continuous DNA strand
  single-strand binding protein:
    - this protein holds the DNA strands apart while they are being replicated
    - this protein stabilizes the open conformation of the unwound DNA
  DNA polymerase I:
    - this enzyme replaces the RNA primers with DNA in the Okazaki fragments
    - this enzyme removes RNA primers and fills the gaps with DNA between Okazaki fragments
    - this enzyme removes the RNA primers at the beginning of each Okazaki fragment and replaces them with DNA
  DNA polymerase III:
    - this enzyme produces the majority of DNA polymer during DNA replications
    - this enzyme is responsible for the synthesis of most of the bacterial chromosome
    - this enzyme synthesizes DNA on both the leading strand and the lagging strand
    - this enzyme is responsible for synthesizing the entire leading strand
