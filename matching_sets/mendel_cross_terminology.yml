matching pairs:
  test cross:
    - a type of cross where the dominant phenotype is crossed with the homozygous recessive genotype
    - a type of cross that uses a homozygous recessive organism to determine the genetic makeup of another dominant organism
    - a type of cross involving an individual which is homozygous recessive for all genes of interest
    - a type of cross where a dominant phenotype (with unknown genotype) to a homozygous recessive genotype
    - a type of cross where a test organism showing a dominant trait is crossed with one showing all recessive traits
    - a type of cross between a homozygous recessive individual with an individual of an unknown dominant genotype
    - a type of cross of an individual of dominant phenotype and unknown genotype and an individual with a homozygous recessive genotype

  backcross:
    - a type of cross where F<sub>1</sub> hybrids are crossed with one of the parental genotypes
    - a type of cross when F<sub>1</sub> individuals are crossed with one of the two parents

  hybrid cross:
    - a type of cross between two individuals who have homozygous genotypes
    - a type of cross between two true-breeding individuals
    - a type of cross that mates two true-breeding individuals that differ

  reciprocal cross:
    - a type of cross designed to test the role of parental sex on a given inheritance pattern
    - two separate crosses where the traits of the male and female in one cross are switche in another cross

  P:
    - the parental generation in a hybrid cross
    - this generation are both true-breeding individuals with different traits in a hybrid cross
    - this generation consists of two homozygous individuals with different phenotypes for a hybrid cross

  F<sub>1</sub>:
    - the first generation in a cross; the offspring of the parental generation
    - hybrid offspring of the parental generation

  F<sub>2</sub>:
    - the second generation in a cross; the offspring of the F<sub>1</sub> generation
    - the second generation produced when F<sub>1</sub> individuals are self-crossed or fertilized with each other
    - the offspring of the F<sub>1</sub> generation; the "<i>grandchildren</i>" of the parental generation
