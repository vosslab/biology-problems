# Guidelines for Mendel's cross breeding concepts statements
# 1. Avoid using tip-off keywords in the descriptions for the cross (e.g., back, test, reciprocal, hydrid.
# 2. Synonyms for keywords are acceptable, like "reverses" for "reciprocal," but avoid making a direct connection.
# 3. Use Mendelian specific genetics vocabulary, such as genes, factors, dominant, recessive, phenotype, genotype, character, trait.
# 4. Avoid complex non-genetics vocabulary (e.g., counterpart, constitute, manifest, contrasting, dictates, precedence, filial).
# 5. Use accurate genetics vocabulary: differentiate between trait/character, dominant/recessive, genotype/phenotype.
# 6. Keep the focus on "types of genetics crosses"; avoid modern exceptions like co-dominance, epistasis, and linked genes
# 7. Be clear and simple; the statements should be easily understood by those with a basic understanding of genetics.
