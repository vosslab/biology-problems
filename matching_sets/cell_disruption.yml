matching pairs:
  Enzymatic method:
    - chemical reactions digest the cell wall
    - cells are suspended in buffers containing protein catalysts that digest the cell wall
    - digestive protein catalysts digest and decompose the microbial cell wall
    - lysozyme is commonly used to digest the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria

  Bead beating:
    - tiny glass particles are mixed and stirred to a high level agitation
    - this technique involves using glass or metal particles to apply gentle abrasion while vortexing them
    - small glass particles are placed into a blender and act like bullets smashing the cells
    - small glass or ceramic particles are used to crack open cells

  Sonication:
    - this technique applies high-frequency sound waves to shatter the cells
    - this technique uses short bursts of ultrasonic waves to disrupt the tissue
    - high-frequency sound waves cause disruption of cells by shear force and tension
    - ultrasonic sound energy is used to cause air bubbles in a liquid to implode damaging the cells
    - high-frequency sound waves produce tiny bubbles that explode, producing a local shockwave
    - this technique uses the forces of ultrasonic waves in order to rupture cells

  Freeze-thaw:
    - this technique uses extremely cold temperatures and grinding to pulverize the cells
    - under cold temperatures the water inside the cells expands into ice causing the cells to burst open
    - cell suspensions are subjected to variable temperatures that results in rupture of the walls
    - cold temperatures form ice crystals, which expand, and this ultimately causes the cell wall to rupture

  Mortar and pestle:
    - samples are ground to break to apart into small pieces
    - this is laborious manual work that can take several minutes
    - grinding of the cells such that they are disrupted

  Dounce homogenizer:
    - handheld device that spins in a tube to smash the cells
    - handheld cylindrical glass tube and a pestle that has a tight fit within the shaft

  Mechanical homogenizer:
    - this technique works like drill with spinning rotor blades to shear the cells apart
    - consists of a fast-spinning inner rotor with a stationary outer stator to produce shearing forces
    - motorized device with rotating blades that shears the cells apart

  French press:
    - a hydraulic piston within a cylinder forces the cells through a small hole using high pressure
    - a hydraulic press drives a piston to squeeze the sample through a needle valve
    - cell suspension is forced through a narrow valve using a hydraulic piston
    - cell suspension is forced by a piston-type pump under high pressure through a small orifice

  Microfluidizer:
    - a high pressure pump pushes the cells through a Z-shaped interaction chamber
    - uses a pump and a Z-shaped interaction chamber to create high pressures

  High throughput homogenizer:
    - a bead beating machine that can process a large number of samples simultaneously in a short time

exclude pairs:
  - [High throughput homogenizer, Bead beating]
