  Sonication:
    - This technique applies high-frequency sound waves to shatter cells.
    - This technique uses short bursts of ultrasonic waves to disrupt the tissue.
    - High-frequency sound waves cause disruption of cells by shear force and tension.
    - Ultrasonic sound energy is used to cause air bubbles in a liquid to implode, damaging the cells.

    - Shear force from high-frequency waves disrupts cells.

  Freeze-thaw:
    - This technique uses extremely cold temperatures and grinding to pulverize cells.
    - Under cold temperatures, the water inside the cells expands into ice, causing the cells to burst open.
    - Cell suspensions are subjected to variable temperatures, resulting in rupture of the walls.
    - Cold temperatures form ice crystals, which expand, ultimately causing the cell wall to rupture.
    - Cells are pulverized through a combination of extreme cold.
    - The cell walls rupture due to extreme temperature variations.
    - Extreme temperature variations cause cell wall rupture.
    - Ice crystal expansion leads to cell wall disruption.
