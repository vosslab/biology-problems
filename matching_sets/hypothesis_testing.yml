  Benchmark T-test:
    - Compares the mean of a sample to a known population mean when the population variance is unknown.
    - Used when the population variance is unknown, and you have a smaller sample size (n < 30).
    - The population mean resting heart rate is 70 bpm, but the standard deviation is unknown. You collect a sample of n = 25 patients on a new drug to test if their mean heart rate differs from the population mean.
    - The population mean protein concentration is 50 mg/mL, but the standard deviation is unknown. You are working with n = 20 samples and want to test if the mean protein concentration differs from the known mean.
    - The population mean species richness is 25 species per plot, but the standard deviation is unknown. You have a small sample of n = 18 plots and want to test if species richness differs from the population mean.
    - The average blood sugar level in the population is 90 mg/dL, but the standard deviation is unknown. You collect a sample of n = 20 patients and want to test if their average blood sugar level differs from the population mean.
    - The average protein concentration in a standard cell line is 50 mg/mL, but the standard deviation is unknown. You collect n = 15 samples from a modified cell line to test if the mean protein concentration differs from the standard.
