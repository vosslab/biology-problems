    - each variant for a character, such as round or wrinkled seeds in flowers
    - a distinct variant of a character of an organism, such as purple or white color for flowers
    - a distinct variant of a character of an organism, such as short or long stems in flowers

  genotype:
    - the genetic constitution of an organism
    - combination of alleles that determines a specific trait
    - genetic content of an organism to make a specific trait
    - chemical makeup of DNA that causes a particular phenotype
    - Mendel refered to this as the <i>"internal nature"</i> of an organism

  phenotype:
    - the observable traits of an organism
    - the observable traits of an individual, such as eye color and blood type
    - the observable traits of an individual, such as height and blood type
    - the observable traits of an individual, such as height and eye color

    - observable characteristics due to how its genes interact with the environment
    - all the observable characteristics of an organism
    - Mendel refered to this as the <i>"external resemblance"</i> of an organism

  alleles:
    - different versions of the same gene, such as <strong>A</strong> or <strong>a</strong>
    - one of two or more versions of DNA sequence at a given genomic location
    - one of two or more alternative forms of a gene at the same site in a chromosome
    - alternative forms of a gene
    - variants of the gene
    - alternative DNA sequences at a locus
    - either of a pair of Mendelian characters that may occur in an organism
    - variations at one gene locus
    - variants at a gene locus that code for a specific traits

  gamete:
    - a haploid reproductive cell having the half number of chromosomes
    - a general term for either male (sperm) or female (egg) germ cells, which unite to form the zygote
    - a haploid cell (e.g., sperm or egg) that fuses with another haploid cell during fertilization in organisms
    - sex, or reproductive, cell containing only one set of dissimilar chromosomes
    - reproductive cells carrying only one copy of each chromosome in preparation for fertilization

  heterozygous:
    - when two copies of a gene are different
    - different alleles at one or more corresponding chromosomal loci
    - two different alleles of a given gene
    - different inherited versions of a gene from each biological parent
    - possession of a pair of differing alleles

  homozygous:
    - the two copies of a gene are identical
    - identical alleles at one or more corresponding chromosomal loci
    - two identical alleles of a given gene
    - identical inherited versions of a gene from each biological parent
    - possession of a pair of identical alleles

  dominant:
    - describes a trait that masks the expression of another trait when both versions of the gene are present
    - describes a trait that masks the expression of another trait when the alleles for both traits are present
    - if two copies of a gene are different, this allele will be expressed

  recessive:
    - describes a trait whose expression is masked by another trait when both versions of the gene are present
    - describes a trait whose expression is masked by another trait when the alleles for both traits are present
    - if two copies of a gene are different, this allele will be masked
