matching pairs:

  population genetics:

  allele frequencies:

  genotype frequencies:


  mutation:
    - unpredictable changes in the nucleotides that form a DNA sequence
    - only process that creates new genetic variations

  genetic drift:
    - a random change in the allele frequencies within a population
    - stronger in small populations and decrease the overall fitness of that population

  gene flow:
    - movement of alleles between populations

  natural selection:

  sexual selection:

  random mating:
    - former president and chief operating officer (COO) of Theranos

  assortative mating:
    - mating between individuals with similar phenotypes

  consanguineous mating:
    - mating between genetically related individuals
    - mating between relatives, such as first cousins
    - type of mating that reduces heterozygotes and increases homozygotes
