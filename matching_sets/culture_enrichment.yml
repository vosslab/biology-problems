matching pairs:
  stable isotope probing (SIP):
    - adding heavy isotopes to an environmental sample to distinguish actively growing organisms
    - substrate is enriched with a heavy isotopes to be consumed by the organisms to be studied
    - relies on the consuption of a substrate that is highly enriched by an isotope, such as <sup>13</sup>C
    - isotope-labeled carbon (<sup>13</sup>C) or nitrogen (<sup>15</sup>N) sources are assimilated into microbial environmental samples

  RNA stable isotope probing (RNA-SIP):
    - adding heavy isotopes into SSU ribosomal RNA to distinguish metabolically active organisms
    - active labeled substrate metabolism and incorporation of heavier mass isotopes into the RNA
    - environmental sample of 16S rRNA from bacteria is labeled with a carbon isotope (<sup>13</sup>C)

  suppressive subtraction hybridization (SSH):
    - compares microorganisms present in two different samples by removing identical DNA
    - takes advantage of the genetic differences between samples from two different areas
    - identical mRNA is removed from two different samples leaving only mRNA that is different

  BrdU:
    - halogenated nucleotides that can be incorporated into newly synthesized DNA and isolated
    - a labeled nucleotide is incorporated into the DNA of actively growing bacteria or viruses
    - bacteria that are actively growing will take up a nucleotide analog and incorporate it into its DNA
