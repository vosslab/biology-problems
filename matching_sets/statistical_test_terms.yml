matching pairs:
  critval:
    - found in a table for given degrees of freedom and losa
    - the boundary for how extreme a teststat must be to reject the nullhyp
    - the cutoff used to compare against the observed teststat

  teststat:
    - a function of the data computed to test the nullhyp
    - a function of the data designed to measure agreement or disagreement with the null hypothesis
    - if this value is large in the direction favoring the althyp, there is stronger evidence against the nullhyp
    - the more extreme this value is under the nullhyp, the smaller the p-value

  losa:
    - the probability cutoff used to decide whether to reject the nullhyp
    - the probability cutoff that limits how often we mistakenly reject a true nullhyp (later called a Type I error).
    - the cutoff for how small a p-value must be to reject the nullhyp
    - standard cutoff probability used to determine statistical significance
    - biologists often use a probability of 0.05 (5%) for this value

  p-value:
    - the probability, under the nullhyp, of obtaining a result at least as extreme as the one observed
    - if this value is small, there is stronger evidence in favor of the althyp
    - if this value is small, it suggests that the observed data are not consistent with the nullhyp
    - smaller values typically correspond to more extreme teststat values

  nullhyp:
    - the hypothesis we attempt to find evidence against in a stattest
    - the hypothesis we want to reject in a stattest
    - this hypothesis defines the distribution used for comparison in the test
    - defines the distribution used for comparison in the test
    - defines the reference distribution used for comparison

  althyp:
    - the hypothesis we aim to support indirectly by rejecting another hypothesis
    - this hypothesis can sometimes be true even when the test fails to detect it (later called a Type II error)
    - can be true even if the test fails to detect it (later called a Type II error)
    - this hypothesis represents the possibility that the observed effect is real and not random
    - this hypothesis represents the possibility that the observed effect is not due to random chance
    - represents the possibility that an observed effect or relationship is real and not random
    - represents the possibility that an observed effect or relationship is not due to random chance

  dof:
    - a parameter based on sample size and estimated parameters or constraints
    - a parameter determined by sample size and the number of parameters
    - based on how many independent pieces of information are available
    - the count of values free to vary once constraints are applied
    - depends on sample size and restrictions from estimated parameters
