matching pairs:
  photolithoautotroph:
    - uses light for energy and CO<sub>2</sub> as a carbon&nbsp;source
    - uses light for energy and carbon&nbsp;dioxide as a carbon&nbsp;source
    - obtains energy from light and its organic material is derived from carbon&nbsp;dioxide

  chemolithoautotroph:
    - obtains energy by oxidizing inorganic compounds
    - uses inorganic compounds for both energy and carbon&nbsp;source
    - uses sulfur, iron, or nitrogen as energy sources and carbon&nbsp;dioxide as a carbon&nbsp;source

  chemoorganoheterotroph:
    - derives its energy using organic chemicals from consuming other organisms
    - uses organic compounds for both energy and its carbon&nbsp;source

  chemolithoheterotroph:
    - its energy from the oxidation of inorganic compounds, but uses organic compounds as its carbon&nbsp;source
    - derives its energy using inorganic chemicals, but its carbon from other organisms
    - uses inorganic compounds for energy, but uses organic compounds as its carbon&nbsp;source
    - uses sulfur, iron, or nitrogen as energy sources, but uses organic compounds from other organisms as its carbon&nbsp;source

  photoorganoheterotroph:
    - obtains energy from light and organic material from other organisms
    - obtains energy from light and organic material as its carbon&nbsp;source
    - uses energy from light and organic material from other organisms
    - relys on light for energy and organic compounds from other organisms for survival
    - uses light for energy, but requires organic compounds from other organisms to provide the carbon it needs
