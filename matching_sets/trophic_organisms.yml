  chemoorganoheterotroph:
    - derives its energy using organic chemicals from consuming other organisms
    - uses organic compounds for both energy and its carbon source

  chemolithoheterotroph:
    - its energy from the oxidation of inorganic compounds, but uses organic compounds as its carbon source
