matching pairs:
  non-disjunction:
    - the failure of sister chromatids to separate properly during cell division
    - the failure of homologous chromosomes to separate properly during cell division

  deletion:
    - portion of the chromosome is missing
    - a sequence of DNA is left out during DNA replication
    - a part of a chromosome is left out during DNA replication
    - when a chromosome breaks a part of it is lost
    - can result from ectopic recombination where a part of a chromosome is lost
    - chromosome in which is missing a group of genes

  duplications:
    - portion of the chromosome has been copied, resulting in extra genetic material
    - portion of the chromosome has been copied, resulting extra copies of a gene
    - can result from ectopic recombination where a part of a chromosome is replicated
    - chromosome that has an extra copy of a group of genes

  reciprocal translocation:
    - can change a metacentric chromosome into a submetacentric chromosome
    - a pair of non-homologous chromosomes swapping genes with each other
    - the exchange of broken chromosome segments between two nonhomologous chromosomes
    - two detached fragments of two different chromosomes are switched
    - the Philadelphia chromosome is formed from this alteration of chromosomes 9 and 22
    - segments from two different chromosomes have been exchanged

  non-reciprocal translocation:
    - the transferring of a chromosome segment from one chromosome to another non-homologous chromosome
    - the one-way transfer of a chromosomal segment from one non-homologous chromosome to another
    - a complete chromosome that also has a group of genes from another chromosome

  paracentric inversion:
    - can change two monocentric chromosomes into an acentric chromosome
    - can change two monocentric chromosomes into a dicentric chromosome
    - the reversal of the gene order within a chromosome that does NOT include the centromere
    - two breaks and reversal of the genes occur on one arm of the chromosome
    - does NOT include the centromere and both breaks occur in one arm of the chromosome
    - a portion of a single chromosome arm has broken off, turned upside down, and reattached
    - a portion of a single chromosome arm has broken off, reversed, and reattached in its original place
    - can result from ectopic recombination where a part of a single chromosome arm is reversed
    - a group of genes on one arm of the chromosome is the reverse of the normal order

  pericentric inversion:
    - a pair of homologous chromosomes that both have duplicated genes and missing genes
    - the reversal of the gene order in a chromosome that includes the centromere
    - two breaks and reversal of the genes occurs on both arms or sides of the centromere
    - centromere is included in the reversed loop that is formed during synapsis
    - reversal of the genes that includes both arms of the chromosome
    - includes the centromere and there is a break point in each arm
    - a portion of a chromosome that includes both arms has broken off, turned upside down, and reattached
    - a portion of a chromosome that includes both arms has broken off, reversed, and reattached
    - a group of genes including the centromere is the reverse of the normal order

  Robertsonian translocation:
    - can change two acrocentric chromosomes into a metacentric chromosome
    - fusion of two chromosomes that have short p arms
    - caused by breaks at or near the centromeres of two acrocentric chromosomes
    - in humans, these alterations only occur with chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22
    - entire chromosome has attached to another at the centromere
