matching pairs:
  critval:
    - found in a table for a given degrees of freedom and losa
    - the boundary of how extreme a test statistic we need to reject the nullhyp
    - the cutoff used to compare against the observed chi2 test statistic
    - a measure of the discrepancy between the observed and expected data sets
    - the sum of the normalized square difference between observed and expected data

  chi2 test statistic:
    - if this value is large, then there is stronger evidence in favor of the althyp
    - if this value is large, then there is stronger evidence in against of the nullhyp
    - the bigger this number, the smaller the p-value

  losa:
    - the statistical cutoff of the result for the nullhyp to be true or false
    - a constant probability that provides a cutoff for falsification of the nullhyp
    - the fixed probability for elimination of nullhyp
    - a fixed probability cutoff whether the nullhyp is assumed to be accepted or rejected
    - the cutoff of how small a p-value we need to reject the nullhyp
    - standard cutoff probability used to determine statistic significance
    - biologists use a probability of 0.05 (5%) for this value

  p-value:
    - the probability of getting a result that is either the same or more extreme than the actual observations
    - represents the probability of occurrence of the given observations
    - if this value is small, then there is stronger evidence in favor of the althyp
    - if this value is small, then there is stronger evidence in against of the nullhyp
    - the smaller this number, the bigger the chi2 test statistic
    - if this value is small, it suggests that the observed data are not consistent with the nullhyp

  nullhyp:
    - we attempt to find evidence against this hypothesis in our chi2 test
    - we want to reject this hypothesis in our chi2 test
    - this hypothesis makes it easier to calculate the expected values

  althyp:
    - we are attempting to demonstrate this hypothesis in an indirect way by using the chi2 test
    - if the nullhyp is disproved, then this opposing hypothesis gets accepted
    - we want to accept this hypothesis in our chi2 test
    - for this hypothesis, the expected values may be impossible to calculate

  dof:
    - most often this number is one less than the number of observations (rows in our table)
    - represents how many independent values can vary in the calculation after constraints are applie
    - in a chi2 test, it is usually the number of categories minus one
    - this value determines which row of the chi2 critval table you should use
