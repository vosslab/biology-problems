matching pairs:
  critval:
    - found in a table for a given degrees of freedom and losa
    - the boundary of how extreme a test statistic we need to reject the nullhyp
    - the cutoff used to compare against the observed chi2 test statistic

  chi2 test statistic:
    - if this value is large, then there is stronger evidence to support the althyp
    - if this value is large, then there is stronger evidence to reject the nullhyp
    - the bigger this number, the smaller the p-value
    - the sum of the normalized square difference between observed and expected data
    - a measure of the discrepancy between the observed and expected data sets

  losa:
    - the statistical cutoff of the result for the nullhyp to be rejected or not
    - a constant probability that provides a cutoff for falsification of the nullhyp
    - the fixed probability for rejection of nullhyp
    - a fixed probability cutoff whether the nullhyp can be rejected
    - the cutoff of how small a p-value we need to reject the nullhyp
    - standard cutoff probability used to determine statistic significance
    - biologists use a probability of 0.05 (5%) for this value

  p-value:
    - the probability of getting a result that is either the same or more extreme than the actual observations
    - if this value is small, then there is stronger evidence to support the althyp
    - if this value is small, then there is stronger evidence to reject the nullhyp
    - the smaller this number, the bigger the chi2 test statistic
    - a small value suggests the observed data are not consistent with the nullhyp

  nullhyp:
    - we attempt to find evidence against this hypothesis in our chi2 test
    - we want to reject this hypothesis in our chi2 test
    - this hypothesis makes it easier to calculate the expected values

  althyp:
    - we are attempting to support this hypothesis indirectly by using the chi2 test
    - if the nullhyp is rejected, then this opposing hypothesis is supported
    - this hypothesis represents a deviation or bias from the expected pattern
    - for this hypothesis, the expected values are often impossible to calculate
    - we aim to support this hypothesis in our chi2 test

  dof:
    - usually one less than the number of observed categories (rows in the table)
    - represents how many independent values can vary after constraints are applied
    - in most chi2 tests, it is the number of observed categories (rows in the table) minus one
    - this number determines which row of the chi2 critval table you should use
