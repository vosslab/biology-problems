matching pairs:
  homologous chromosomes:
    - two similar but different copies of a chromosome
    - one chromosome from the mother and one chromosome from the father
    - two chromosomes which carry the same genes, one from each parental source
    - chromosomes which contain the same genes in the same order along their chromosomal arms
    - chromosomes of similar length, gene position, and centromere location
    - two chromosomes containing identical genetic loci although possibly different allelic forms
    - chromosome pairs (one from each parent) that are similar in length, gene position, and centromere location

  homologousx:
    - not an exact copy but having the same structural features and pattern of genes
    - corresponding or similar in position, value, structure, or function
    - similar in structure and evolutionary origin, though not necessarily in function
    - corresponding or alike in certain critical attributes
    - denoting organs or parts corresponding in evolutionary origin and similar to some extent in structure
    - having a similar position, structure, value, or purpose

  synapsis:
    - process of pairing of homologous (maternal and paternal) chromosomes
    - the lengthwise pairing of homologous chromosomes
    - the joining of the two homologous chromosomes
    - the matching-up of homologous pairs prior to their segregation
    - homologous chromosomes pair with their counterparts and remain bound
    - pairing of homologous chromosomes prior to their separation into daughter cells

  sister chromatids:
    - two identical copies of a single replicated chromosome joined at the centromere
    - two identical copies of the same chromosome formed by DNA replication
    - two identical copies of the same chromosome attached to each other by the centromere
    - a single duplicated chromosome with a common centromere
    - identical copies (chromatids) of a chromosome formed by DNA replication
    - two identical copies of a chromosome joined together by a common centromere
    - two identical chromatids that are formed by replication of a chromosome
    - two identical copies of one chromosome specifically created for cell division

  crossing over:
    - the exchange of genes between homologous chromosomes, resulting in a mixture of parental characteristics
    - two homologous chromosomes line up and parts of the chromosomes can be exchanged
    - the exchange of genes between two homologous chromosomes, resulting in a mixture of parental characteristics
    - the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes
    - the actual exchange of segments between homologous chromosomes
    - a process by which parts of homologous chromosomes are interchanged

  chiasmata:
    - the physical link between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes that remain after crossing over
    - the point of contact between paired chromatids that marks a crossover site
    - specialized chromatin structures that link homologous chromosomes together
    - the visible link between two (non-sister) chromatids belonging to homologous chromosomes
    - the region where homologous chromosomes stay connected after crossing over
    - a point of overlap of paired chromatids at which exchange of genetic material has taken place
