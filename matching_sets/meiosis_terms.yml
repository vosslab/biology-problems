matching pairs:
  homologous chromosomes:
    - two similar but different copies of a chromosome
    - one chromosome from the mother and one chromosome from the father
    - two chromosomes which carry the same genes, one from each parental source
    - chromosomes which contain the same genes in the same order along their chromosomal arms
    - chromosomes of similar length, gene position, and centromere location
    - two chromosomes containing identical genetic loci although possibly different allelic forms
    - chromosome pairs (one from each parent) that are similar in length, gene position, and centromere location

  homologous:
    - not an exact copy but having the same structural features and pattern of genes

  synapsis:
    - process of pairing of homologous (maternal and paternal) chromosomes

  sister chromatids:
    - two identical copies of a single replicated chromosome. They are joined at the centromere

  crossing over:
    - the exchange of genes between homologous chromosomes, resulting in a mixture of parental characteristics in offspring

  chiasmata:
    - the point of contact (or physical link) between two homologous chromosomes where crossing over occurs
