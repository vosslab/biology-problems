matching pairs:
  Acentric:
    - an abnormal chromosome that lacks a centromere
    - spindle fibers cannot attach and the chromosome is lost when the cell divides
    - an unstable chromosome lacking spindle fiber attachment
    - an unstable chromosome with no centromere
    - the chromosome most resembles the letter V during metaphase before separation

  Acrocentric:
    - the short arm of the chromosome is so short that it is hard to observe
    - the chromosome most resembles the letter V during metaphase before separation
    - the centromere is located very close to one end of the chromosome
    - the chromosome most resembles the letter I after separation
    - the centromere is closer to the end rather than the center
    - the centromere is very offset from the center leading to a very short arm
    - a chromosome with one very long arm and one very short arm

  Dicentric:
    - an abnormal chromosome that has two centromeres that often appear in cancer cells
    - an abnormal chromosome with two centromeres that often appear in cancer cells
    - an unstable chromosome due to unpredictable spindle fiber attachment
    - a chromosome with formed through the fusion of two chromosome segments, each with a centromere
    - genomic rearrangements placing two centromeres on the same chromosome

  Metacentric:
    - the two arms of the chromosomes are almost equal
    - the chromosome most resembles the letter V after separation
    - the chromosome most resembles a perfect letter X during metaphase
    - the centromere is located midway between the ends of the chromosome
    - a chromosome with a centrally placed centromere
    - the centromere divides the chromosome into two arms with equal length
    - a chromosome with two arms of equal length

  Submetacentric:
    - the chromosome most resembles the letter J after separation
    - a chromosome with slightly shorter p arm relative to q arm
    - the centromere situated so that one arm is somewhat shorter than the other
    - a slight asymmetry in the length of the two chromosome arms
    - the centromere slightly offset from the center
