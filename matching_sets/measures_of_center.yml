    - The measure calculated by dividing the sum of all data points by the number of data points.
    - A central tendency measure determined by the total sum of values divided by how many values there are.

  Mode:
    - The value or values that occur most frequently in the data set.
    - The most common data point(s) within a set.
    - The value that appears with the greatest frequency in the set.

  Median:
    - The value located at the midpoint of an ordered data set, or the average of two middle values for an even set.
    - The middle number in a sorted list of values, or the average of the two central numbers if the data count is even.
    - The middle value of an arranged set, splitting the data into two equal halves.

  Midrange:
    - The value obtained by adding the maximum and minimum values in the set, then dividing the result by two.
    - The midpoint between the smallest and largest values in the data set.
    - The value calculated by taking the sum of the highest and lowest values and halving it.
