matching pairs:
  gene therapy:
    - treating cystic fibrosis using adenovirus to introduce a functioning protein channel
    - engineering virus for injection into a tumor to promote apoptosis
    - introducing a new gene on a plasmid into a patient to replace a faulty &beta;-thalassemia enzyme
    - culture and reprogram blood progenitor cells from bone marrow to kill HIV-infected cells
    - mRNA vaccines express the viral spike proteins to train the immune system to recognize the virus

  genome editing:
    - using CRISPR to change a single nucleotide in sickle-cell allele
    - deleting the fragments of HIV DNA from the genome of an infected patient
    - correcting a mutation within the host genome that causes liver disease
    - using zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) mediated treatment to replace a nucleotide in the diseased &beta;-thalassemia allele
    - using transcriptor activator-like effector nuclease (TALENs) to correct inherited retinal dystrophy
    - CRISPR is used to insert a functional micro-dystrophin gene correcting Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)
    - correct defective DNA elements within a gene
