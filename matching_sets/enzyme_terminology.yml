matching pairs:
  Substrate:
    - a molecule (reactant) that is acted upon by an enzyme
    - a molecule that is transformed into a product by an enzyme

  Reagent:
    - a molecule that facilitates a chemical reaction
    - a substance that participates in a chemical reaction
    - substance used to cause or facilitate a chemical reaction
    - can be either reactants or catalysts that play a role in a chemical reaction

  Reactant:
    - a molecule that is consumed by a chemical reaction
    - substance that is transformed into one or more chemical products.

  Product:
    - something manufactured by an enzyme from its substrate
    - any substance that is produced as a result of a chemical reaction

  Transition state:
    - intermediate, short-lived, high energy state of the substrate before forming the product
    - an intermediate, high-energy stage in a chemical reaction

  Enzyme:
    - proteins that catalyze chemical reactions
    - proteins that increase the rate of reactions

  Ribozyme:
    - RNA molecules that catalyze chemical reactions
    - nucleic acids that can catalyze chemical reactions

  Active site:
    - part of an enzyme where substrates bind and undergo a chemical reaction
    - specific region where substrate molecules bind and undergo a chemical reaction
    - a site on an enzyme designed for precise interactions with the substrate
    - part of an enzyme that provides the environment necessary for the chemical reaction to occur

  Ligand:
    - any substance that forms a complex with a biomolecule to serve a biological purpose
    - usually a small molecule, such as a hormone, neurotransmitter, or drug, that binds to a protein

  Ligand-binding site:
    - location on biomolecule where an important small molecule binds
    - binding site on the enzyme that can alter its activity and is often a target for drugs

  Cofactor:
    - non-protein small molecules that some enzymes require for activity
    - non-protein substances required for enzyme activity
    - either metallic ions or small organic molecules required for enzyme activity

  Coenzyme:
    - organic molecules derived from vitamins
    - organic molecules required for enzyme activity

  Prosthetic group:
    - tightly bound coenzymes
    - organic molecules tightly bound to an enzyme

  Holoenzyme:
    - enzyme with bound cofactors
    - protein along with one or more cofactors
    - a complete enzyme complex

  Apoenzyme:
    - enzyme without its cofactors
    - an inactive enzyme that missing its cofactors

exclude pairs:
  - [Coenzyme, Cofactor, Prosthetic group]
  - [Ligand, Ligand binding site]
