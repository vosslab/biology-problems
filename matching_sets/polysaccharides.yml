matching pairs:
  glycogen:
    - storage form of glucose in animals
    - animal polysaccharide that contains &alpha;-glycosidic linkages
    - animal molecule composed of linear chains of &alpha;-(1,4) D-glucose residues connected through &alpha;-(1,6) linkages
    - glucose storage found in skeleton muscle and liver cells
    - highly branched polymer of &alpha;-linked glucose units found in animals
    - highly branched energy storage in animals
  amylopectin:
    - branched storage form of glucose in plants
    - highly branched polymer of &alpha;-linked glucose units found in plants
    - highly branched glucose polymer found in plants that is readily digested by humans and other mammals
    - plant molecule composed of linear chains of &alpha;-(1,4) D-glucose residues connected through &alpha;-(1,6) linkages
    - moderately branched energy storage in plants
  amylose:
    - unbranched storage form of glucose in plants
    - unbranched energy storage in plants
    - linear chain of glucose with &alpha;-glycosidic linkages and no branches
    - also know as resistant starch, because it has no branches and it is resistant to digestion
  chitin:
    - structural form of glucose in some animals
    - animal polysaccharide that contains &beta;-glycosidic linkages
    - major structural component of arthopod (e.g., insects) exoskeletons
    - polymer of &beta;-linked glucose units found in some animals
    - carbohydrate polymer that used for structural purposes by some animals
    - structural material in arthropods and fungi
  cellulose:
    - structural form of glucose in plants
    - major structural component of cell walls
    - plant polysaccharide that contains &beta;-glycosidic linkages
    - polymer of &beta;-linked glucose units found in plants
    - carbohydrate polymer that used for structural purposes by plants
    - structural material in plant cell walls
