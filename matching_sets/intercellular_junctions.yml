key description: intercellular junctions

value description: function

matching pairs:
  desmosome:
    - a dense attachment of anchoring proteins that a provide strong adhesion between cells
    - an adhesive junction that is crucial to tissues that experience mechanical stress
    - anchoring spots found all around cells that bind two adjacent cells together
    - one of the stronger junctions found in tissue that experience intense mechanical stress
  gap junction:
    - collection of protein channels that allow the direct transfer of signal molecules between cells
    - collection of protein channels that facilitates passage of ions, hormones, and neurotransmitters
    - collection of protein channels that allow for intercellular communication
    - two adjacent cells are connected through a collection of protein channels
    - collection of protein channels that directly connect the cytoplasm of two adjacent cells
    - collection of protein channels that allow electrical impulses to directly pass between cells
  plasmodesmata:
    - large tubes which traverse cell walls enabling transport and communication between cells
    - large tubes that pass through openings in cell walls linking one cell to another
  tight junction:
    - forms a seal between the two membranes to prevent passive flow between cells
    - membranes join together forming a virtual impermeable barrier to fluid
    - areas where the membranes of two adjacent cells join together to form a barrier
    - parallel interweaving strands between two membranes that greatly reduce the flow of macromolecules between cells
    - outer layers of the cell membranes are fused, reducing the ability of larger molecules to pass between
    - closely associated areas of two adjacent cells whose membranes join together to form a virtually impermeable barrier to fluid
    - seal between the membranes of two adjacent cells to prevent leakage of solutes and water
    - connections formed by cells that fuse together so that a relatively impermeable barrier is created
