# Changelog

## 2026-01-22
- Resolved merge conflicts in [docs/CODE_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/CODE_ARCHITECTURE.md) and [docs/FILE_STRUCTURE.md](docs/FILE_STRUCTURE.md) to align test/tool references with the current repo layout.
- Standardized lxml etree imports in gene mapping and treelib HTML validation helpers after merge resolution.
- Removed legacy [problems/multiple_choice_statements/yaml_to_pg.py](../problems/multiple_choice_statements/yaml_to_pg.py) during conflict cleanup to match the current PGML workflow.
